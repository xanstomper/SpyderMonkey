# Compilation formats (per consumer) — chain composition

- source canon: `kairo/synthesis-engine.md`
- base technique: `kairo-synthesis-engine-compilation-formats-per-consumer.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

**3AM** (`~/.redteam/learned-vectors.jsonl`, schema-true):
```json
{"flaw": 6, "seam": "C", "probe": "KAIRO SYNTH BOUNDARY :: fire the scoped request…", "confirmed_when": "foreign scope returns 200…"}
```
→ 3AM `promote --apply --verified` merges into the living matrix.

**UNDERCROFT** (campaign `undercroft-state.json` → `pocs`):
```json
{"finding": "SV-…-BOUNDARY", "request": "fire the scoped request…", "proof": "…", "class": "IDOR"}
```

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
