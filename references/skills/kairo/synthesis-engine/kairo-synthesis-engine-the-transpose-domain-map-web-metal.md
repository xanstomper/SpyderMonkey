# The TRANSPOSE domain map (web → metal)

- source canon: `kairo/synthesis-engine.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHZ-04** · **CWE-639** · **ATT&CK T1068**
- generated: 2026-11-07

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

| Web class | Metal analogue | The transposed probe |
|---|---|---|
| BOUNDARY | HWFLASH | scope-id trust on update/extract paths — swapped slot ids (lab, owned device) |
| REPLAY | HDRADIO | pairing/replay window — capture + replay ack frames (lab spectrum) |
| STATEBYPASS | HWFLASH | out-of-order OTA/bootloader stages — N+2 before N+1 |
| MATH | HDRADIO | precision drift in radio counters — worst values ×N |
| ENTITLEMENT | HWFLASH | provisioning order — entitlement flag before its check |
| AUTHBYPASS | HDRADIO | pairing-material entropy — effective bits from captures |

`kairo crossdomain --target T --from web --to hardware|radio` registers each as a
PROBED plane-ledger plan — lab-first, owned devices, never auto-CONFIRMED, never
distributed.
