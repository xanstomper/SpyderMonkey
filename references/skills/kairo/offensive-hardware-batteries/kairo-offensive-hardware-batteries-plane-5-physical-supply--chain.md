# Plane 5 — Physical & supply — chain composition

- source canon: `kairo/offensive-hardware-batteries.md`
- base technique: `kairo-offensive-hardware-batteries-plane-5-physical-supply.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `sslscan`, `sslyze`, `testssl`, `tlsx`, `ssh-audit`, `openssl`, `nmap-ssl-ciphers`, `nmap-script-ssl`, `ssh-keyscan`
- chains: `tls`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

| Probe | Test | Confirmed-when |
|---|---|---|
| Tamper/documentation | visual + silkscreen review (no opening if not owned) | exposed debug headers, test points |
| Default credentials | documented vendor default lists vs device login (declared estate) | login with default |
| OEM/ODM surface | firmware strings/manufacturer portal enumeration (public) | OEM image/backdoor suspicion documented |
| Implant analysis | on OWN device: PCB review, unknown-component identification | unexpected modem/crypto/logging IC |
| Supply-chain image | hash + sign comparison of shipped image vs vendor published (owned) | image mismatch |

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
