# The harvest surface (GET-only, `hunt --live`) — websocket / federated

- source canon: `shukaku/harvest-playbook.md`
- base technique: `shukaku-harvest-playbook-the-harvest-surface-get-only-hunt-l.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-INPV-05** · **CWE-89** · **ATT&CK T1190**
- context: **websocket** · auth **federated** · chain role **final**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-http-backup`, `nmap-robots`, `nmap-sitemap`, `snallygaster`, `wget-mirror`, `httrack`, `gau`, `git-dumper`, `trufflehog`, `gitleaks`
- chains: `exposure-sweep`, `content`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: state carries across frames — the replay/state-bypass classes apply frame-to-frame
- auth state: identity rides an external IdP (OAuth/OIDC/SAML/SSO): the differential is the TOKEN — audience, issuer, redirect_uri, scope downgrades, code/state reuse, and the exchange at the resource server; the local session may be fine while the trust boundary is not

## The technique

backup archives (`backup.zip|tar.gz|sql`, `dump.sql`, `db.sqlite`…), env/config
leaks (`.env`, `.git/config`, `config.*.bak`), admin/admin-export paths,
`api/export(s)`, `debug/vars`, `server-status`. Data plane only — route probing is
UNDERCROFT's. 200s register CONFIRMED with body sizes; **nothing is downloaded**.

## Probe adjustment (websocket × federated)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- the impact leg — shukaku prices what this rung reaches
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
