# Evidence-chain rules — chain composition

- source canon: `shukaku/harvest-playbook.md`
- base technique: `shukaku-harvest-playbook-evidence-chain-rules.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

1. Every crown entry: `SOURCE → PROOF → SCOPE → CLASS → VALUE → DISCLOSE`.
2. SOURCE must be a real finding ID (3AM chain, case file, ledger entry) — a harvest
   entry with no source is a fabrication.
3. PROOF must be reproducible read-only (command ref, output hash reference).
4. SCOPE is counts, never contents; samples ≤3, redacted, hashed.
5. VALUE carries basis; DISCLOSE carries the obligation + timeline + prerequisite.
6. Re-verify reach before re-asserting (drift first; findings decay).

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
