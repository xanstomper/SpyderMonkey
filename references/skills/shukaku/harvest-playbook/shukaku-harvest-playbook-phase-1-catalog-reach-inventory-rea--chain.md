# Phase 1 — Catalog (reach inventory, read-only) — chain composition

- source canon: `shukaku/harvest-playbook.md`
- base technique: `shukaku-harvest-playbook-phase-1-catalog-reach-inventory-rea.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

| Asset class | Reach proof (read-only) | Registered scope |
|---|---|---|
| SQL DB | `SELECT count(*) FROM <table>` with harvested creds | table · row count · schema classes |
| NoSQL | `db.<col>.count()` (operator-owned) | collection · doc count |
| Object store | bucket listing + key count | bucket · key count · prefixes |
| Backups | backup inventory list (glacier/S3/cron/NFS) | artifact · size · freshness |
| SaaS export | tenant admin export config review (read-only list) | tenant · export scope |
| Source repos | repo list + secret scan (operator-owned code) | repos · secret class counts |
| Device/keys | KAIRO findings: key extraction proof (read-only) | key material type · count |

Sample rule: ≤3 rows, redacted at capture, only to prove class — the register keeps
counts and hashes of samples, never contents.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
