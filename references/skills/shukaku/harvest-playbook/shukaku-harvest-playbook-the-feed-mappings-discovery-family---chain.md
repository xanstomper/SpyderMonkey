# The feed mappings (discovery → family material) — chain composition

- source canon: `shukaku/harvest-playbook.md`
- base technique: `shukaku-harvest-playbook-the-feed-mappings-discovery-family-.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

| Discovery | → 3AM row (flaw · seam) | → undercroft | → holyshit |
|---|---|---|---|
| exposed backup/dump (hunt or BACKUP crown) | 13 cloud-misconfig · K cloud-policy | — | recipe card |
| exposed .env/.git/config | 15 database-exposure · G edgefn<->db | CONFIRMED surface | recipe card |
| admin/export reach (SASS crown) | 6 identifier-trust · C auth<->backend-binding | CONFIRMED surface (admin) | — |
| data plane via harvested access (PII/FIN crown) | 15 database-exposure · G edgefn<->db | — | — |
| SRC crown | 2 trust-in-client-params · B client<->server-validation | — | recipe card |
| CRED crown | 10 entropy/forge · C auth<->backend-binding (reuse check) | — | — |

Feed is idempotent per (kind, what, destination) — never double-shipped. Next
steps after feed: `3AM promote --apply --verified` · `kairo ingest --target <t>`.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
