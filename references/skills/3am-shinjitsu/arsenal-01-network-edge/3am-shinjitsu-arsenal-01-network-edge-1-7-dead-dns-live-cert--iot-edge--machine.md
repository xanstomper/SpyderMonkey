# 1.7 Dead-DNS-live-cert hosts (score 75) — iot-edge / machine

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-01-network-edge.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-01-network-edge-1-7-dead-dns-live-cert.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-04** · **CWE-530** · **ATT&CK T1552**
- context: **iot-edge** · auth **machine** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: device-adjacent runtime at the edge — own devices, lab network
- auth state: the principal is a SERVICE identity (API key, SA token, CI secret, webhook signing key): the differential is the KEY's resource scope — key-level vs user-level objects, cross-tenant reach, unscoped keys, and which audit trail the key leaves; the human account model does not apply

## The technique

- DECISIVE: passive-DNS dump (hackertarget hostsearch) ∩ CT-log names ∖ resolving names.
- CONFIRMED WHEN: `crt.sh` shows cert for a name with no A/AAAA on two public resolvers —
  "internal control panel" signature; try `https://<name>` via origin IP + Host header.

## Probe adjustment (iot-edge × machine)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
