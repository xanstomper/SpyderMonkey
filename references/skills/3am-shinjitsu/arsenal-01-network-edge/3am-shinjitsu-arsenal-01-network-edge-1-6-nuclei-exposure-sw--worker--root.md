# 1.6 Nuclei exposure sweep (score 70, T≈4min, ceiling 1 run) — worker / root

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-01-network-edge.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-01-network-edge-1-6-nuclei-exposure-sw.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN-04** · **CWE-307** · **ATT&CK T1110**
- context: **worker** · auth **root** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-slowloris-check`, `curl`
- chains: `web`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: edge/background runtime — the check runs where the caller has no visible context
- auth state: the highest local principal — confirm the class from the top down (downgrade/view-as tests, no-gain reads are the crown)

## The technique

- DECISIVE: `nuclei -u https://<target> -tags cve,exposure,panel -rl 10 -severity medium,high,critical -silent`
- RULE: one run, rate-limited. Never re-run without a target change (ledger).
- FP: template matches on CDN-edge paths — verify each match by hand before verdict.

## Probe adjustment (worker × root)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
