# 1.13 Exhaustion ledger template (class 1) — browser / service

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-01-network-edge.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-01-network-edge-1-13-exhaustion-ledger.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-INFO** · **CWE-200** · **ATT&CK T1592**
- context: **browser** · auth **service** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap`, `masscan`, `naabu`, `zmap`, `nc`, `fping`, `nmap-allports`
- chains: `net`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: the CLIENT is the boundary — same-origin, extension, and postMessage trust are the probe shape
- auth state: a daemon/listener identity — the probe targets what the service can see and invoke, not what a human session can

## The technique

```
{"class":"network/edge","probe":"3306-banner","test":"connect :3306 read greeting",
 "result":"5.5.5-10.1.48-MariaDB","verdict":"CONFIRMED","score":85,
 "next":"searchsploit mariadb 10.1 — documented PoC adaptation only"}

## Probe adjustment (browser × service)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
