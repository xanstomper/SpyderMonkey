# 1.3 TLS SAN hidden-host discovery (score 75, T≈2min) — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-01-network-edge.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-01-network-edge-1-3-tls-san-hidden-hos.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- DECISIVE: `echo \| openssl s_client -connect <host>:443 -servername <host> 2>/dev/null \| openssl x509 -noout -ext subjectAltName`
- CONFIRMED WHEN: SAN names absent from DNS enumeration AND bundle strings.
- DISCRIMINATOR: probe SAN children — JSON 404 = real router; HTML 404 = SPA shell (ghost).
- Wildcard parent may be a live backend while children don't resolve.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
