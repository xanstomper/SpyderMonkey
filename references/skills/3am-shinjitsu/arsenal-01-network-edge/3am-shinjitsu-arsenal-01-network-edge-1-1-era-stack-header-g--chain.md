# 1.1 Era-stack header grab (score 80, T≈1min) — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-01-network-edge.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-01-network-edge-1-1-era-stack-header-g.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- DECISIVE: `curl -sI https://<target>/` and on the API host separately
- READ: `Server`, `X-Powered-By`, `via`, `x-served-by`, `x-turbo-by`, `x-kong-*`,
  `www-authenticate`, `content-generator`, `x-generator`
- CONFIRMED WHEN: any component EOL per §1.12 table
- FP: CDN-injected headers (`via` from CF/Fastly is not the origin stack)

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
