# 1.2 CF-origin leak → direct-origin WAF bypass (score 90, T≈3min) — THE first move

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-01-network-edge.md`

## The technique

- DECISIVE: `dig +short <target> TXT @1.1.1.1` → grep `v=spf1 ip4:<ip>`
- VERIFY: python `http.client.HTTPSConnection(<ip>, context=ssl._create_unverified_context())`,
  `Host:`/SNI = `<target>`. Real app HTML (not CF interstitial) = WAF bypassed entirely.
- ALSO: `dig AAAA` — IPv6 often un-CDN'd (shadow surface); check DMARC `rua`/hosting MX headers.
- FP: SPF `include:` chains — resolve the IP in the include, not the include name.
- NEXT: full route map direct-to-origin; re-run ghost-route sweep origin-side (CDN may mask).
