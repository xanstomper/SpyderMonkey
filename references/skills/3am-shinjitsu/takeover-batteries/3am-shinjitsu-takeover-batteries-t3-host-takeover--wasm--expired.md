# T3 — Host takeover — wasm / expired

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/takeover-batteries.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-takeover-batteries-t3-host-takeover.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **wasm** · auth **expired** · chain role **final**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-http-backup`, `nmap-robots`, `nmap-sitemap`, `snallygaster`, `wget-mirror`, `httrack`, `gau`, `git-dumper`, `trufflehog`, `gitleaks`
- chains: `exposure-sweep`, `content`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: sandbox internals — memory/import surface, own compiled artifact only
- auth state: the credential/session has lapsed — the class probes reuse, reactivation, and the no-revoke gap

## The technique

- RCE confirmation (one command, read-only payload via the box's OWN binaries — LOTL);
  SSH key reuse (test the harvested key on the next host: auth success = proof, then
  stop); secret harvest on the box → cloud creds (env vars, `.aws/`, cloud CLI config,
  agent/runner tokens); cron/init/scripts revealing fleet hosts.
- **DECISIVE PROOF:** `id`/`whoami` over the authenticated channel, or the next host's
  SSH auth success. Then STOP.

## Probe adjustment (wasm × expired)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- the impact leg — shukaku prices what this rung reaches
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
