# T7 — Collab/SaaS tenant takeover — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/takeover-batteries.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-takeover-batteries-t7-collab-saas-tenant-takeo.md`
- chain role: **final — this CLOSES a chain: shukaku prices what it reaches; chain detect looks for the entries that feed it**

## Chain roles

- final — this CLOSES a chain: shukaku prices what it reaches; chain detect looks for the entries that feed it

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- OAuth over-grant → full-tenant scope; webhook SSRF → internal admin API; external
  sharing links with elevated defaults; tenant-to-tenant app install (operator-owned
  tenants only); helpdesk trust (documentation only).
- **DECISIVE PROOF:** one read-only tenant-admin API call under the abused grant. Then
  STOP.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
