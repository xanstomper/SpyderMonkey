# T4 — Cloud account takeover

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/takeover-batteries.md`

## The technique

- Secret leak → `sts get-caller-identity` success in the target account; bucket/object
  keys → deeper IAM; metadata/SSRF → instance role credential (one `get-caller-identity`,
  owned infra only for the decisive call); exposed snapshot/AMI → root volume → secrets;
  OIDC federation misconfig (documented-PoC); over-scoped service principals.
- **DECISIVE PROOF:** the harvested identity resolves to the target account and lists
  one resource. Then STOP.
