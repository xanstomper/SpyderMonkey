# Chain certification (state + report)

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

Campaign state `chains[]`: `{crown_jewel, steps, status, impact, evidence}`.
- `steps` written as `A→B→C` where each hop is a confirmed primitive.
- `status: TAKEOVER` only when the final hop's decisive proof LANDED.
- `status: PARTIAL` = primitive confirmed but the impact-gate is missing — name it.
- `status: BLOCKED` = the deck stops here (auth, vantage, wall) — name the exact gap.
Tooling: `python3 scripts/exploit-intel.py chain --target <t> --jewel <crown> \
--steps "A→B→C:TAKEOVER" --impact "<one line>"` — dedupes, renders in `report`.
