# U06 Client & end user — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/universal-coverage.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-universal-coverage-u06-client-end-user.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- [ ] JS/source maps/bundles reviewed for secrets and trust decisions
- [ ] Storage (cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB), CSP, postMessage, and origin checks reviewed
- [ ] Desktop/mobile package permissions, deep links, signing, and update path reviewed
- [ ] Client-only authorization gates treated as UX, not control
- [ ] Artifact provenance and dependency pinning verified

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
