# U08 Compute & containers — mesh / low-priv

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/universal-coverage.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-universal-coverage-u08-compute-containers.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-04** · **CWE-530** · **ATT&CK T1552**
- context: **mesh** · auth **low-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap`, `masscan`, `naabu`, `zmap`, `nc`, `fping`, `nmap-allports`
- chains: `net`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: service-mesh sidecar surface — own mesh, read-only mTLS posture
- auth state: hold ONE low-priv principal; swap object ids/roles upward only (idor/authz classes)

## The technique

- [ ] Base images, packages, config, SBOM, and provenance scanned
- [ ] Container users, capabilities, mounts, sockets, seccomp/AppArmor/SELinux reviewed
- [ ] Kubernetes RBAC, network policies, admission controllers, and secrets encryption reviewed
- [ ] Serverless IAM, trigger sources, env vars, and log retention reviewed
- [ ] Build agents and runners isolated from production credentials

## Probe adjustment (mesh × low-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
