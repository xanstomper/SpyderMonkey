# U09 Data stores & backups

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/universal-coverage.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-04** · **CWE-530** · **ATT&CK T1552**

## Route

- probes: `nmap`, `masscan`, `naabu`, `zmap`, `nc`, `fping`, `nmap-allports`
- chains: `net`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- [ ] Database/search/cache engines, versions, users, TLS, network ACL, and encryption reviewed
- [ ] Object-store policies, bucket ACLs, presigned URL handling, and versioning reviewed
- [ ] Replication, backup encryption, retention, restore test, and deletion protection reviewed
- [ ] Least-privilege application identities and query monitoring verified
- [ ] Data classification and redaction in logs/test evidence enforced
