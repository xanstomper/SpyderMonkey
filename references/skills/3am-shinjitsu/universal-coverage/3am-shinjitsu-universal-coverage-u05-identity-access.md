# U05 Identity & access

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/universal-coverage.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**
- generated: 2026-11-04

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- [ ] SSO/OAuth/OIDC/SAML redirect, state, nonce, audience, and callback binding reviewed
- [ ] Password reset/MFA/recovery and session invalidation paths reviewed
- [ ] Privileged roles, service accounts, secrets rotation, and break-glass access audited
- [ ] Least-privilege and conditional access policies evaluated
- [ ] Token storage, scope, expiry, refresh, and revocation checked
