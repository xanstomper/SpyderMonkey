# U14 Detection & response — cloud / service

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/universal-coverage.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-universal-coverage-u14-detection-response.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-INFO** · **CWE-200** · **ATT&CK T1592**
- context: **cloud** · auth **service** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: control-plane exposure — read-only, crown the class
- auth state: a daemon/listener identity — the probe targets what the service can see and invoke, not what a human session can

## The technique

- [ ] Asset coverage mapped against SIEM/EDR/NDR data sources
- [ ] High-value alerts tested through approved purple-team cases
- [ ] Log integrity, time sync, retention, and forensic readiness verified
- [ ] Incident runbooks, revocation, and rollback paths exercised
- [ ] Detection gaps and tuning backlog documented

## Probe adjustment (cloud × service)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
