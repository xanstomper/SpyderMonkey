# U08 Compute & containers

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/universal-coverage.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-04** · **CWE-530** · **ATT&CK T1552**
- generated: 2026-11-04

## Route

- probes: `nmap`, `masscan`, `naabu`, `zmap`, `nc`, `fping`, `nmap-allports`
- chains: `net`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- [ ] Base images, packages, config, SBOM, and provenance scanned
- [ ] Container users, capabilities, mounts, sockets, seccomp/AppArmor/SELinux reviewed
- [ ] Kubernetes RBAC, network policies, admission controllers, and secrets encryption reviewed
- [ ] Serverless IAM, trigger sources, env vars, and log retention reviewed
- [ ] Build agents and runners isolated from production credentials
