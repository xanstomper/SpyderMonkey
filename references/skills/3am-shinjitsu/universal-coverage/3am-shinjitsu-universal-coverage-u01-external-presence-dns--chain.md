# U01 External presence & DNS — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/universal-coverage.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-universal-coverage-u01-external-presence-dns.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-smtp-commands`, `nmap-smtp-enum-users`, `swaks`, `dig-mx`, `dig-txt`
- chains: `mail-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- [ ] CT logs / passive DNS / search index / paste mirrors mapped
- [ ] All apex, wildcard, IPv4/IPv6, mail, CAA, SPF/DKIM/DMARC, NS records reviewed
- [ ] TLS chain, HSTS, cert names, expired/shadow certs, host header behavior mapped
- [ ] CDN/WAF/load-balancer behavior distinguished from origin reachability
- [ ] Dead DNS records with live certificates or stale targets flagged

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
