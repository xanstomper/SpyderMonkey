# U13 AI & LLM systems — edge-node / unauth

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/universal-coverage.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-universal-coverage-u13-ai-llm-systems.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **edge-node** · auth **unauth** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap`, `masscan`, `naabu`, `zmap`, `nc`, `fping`, `nmap-allports`
- chains: `net`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: cdn/origin edge — cache key and origin-pull trust are the class surface
- auth state: no credential material — the classic differential applies as-is; absent auth = the authn-bypass class

## The technique

- [ ] Data flows, tool permissions, network egress, and tenant boundaries mapped
- [ ] Prompt isolation, RAG document permissions, and cross-user context leakage reviewed
- [ ] Agent actions require explicit authorization and have audit/rollback
- [ ] Model/gateway routing, keys, budgets, and logging reviewed
- [ ] Output used for execution/authorization is independently validated

## Probe adjustment (edge-node × unauth)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
