# U06 Client & end user

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/universal-coverage.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- generated: 2026-11-07

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- [ ] JS/source maps/bundles reviewed for secrets and trust decisions
- [ ] Storage (cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB), CSP, postMessage, and origin checks reviewed
- [ ] Desktop/mobile package permissions, deep links, signing, and update path reviewed
- [ ] Client-only authorization gates treated as UX, not control
- [ ] Artifact provenance and dependency pinning verified

## Family use

- decisive-test shape lives in the source canon
- walls: validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
