# U12 Endpoint & devices — embedded / high-priv

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/universal-coverage.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-universal-coverage-u12-endpoint-devices.md`
- bindings: **MASTG-RES** · **CWE-494** · **ATT&CK T1601**
- context: **embedded** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap`, `masscan`, `naabu`, `zmap`, `nc`, `fping`, `nmap-allports`
- chains: `net`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: banner/identity reads only on in-scope industrial tiers — control writes are the absolute wall
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

- [ ] Managed fleet enrollment, patch level, EOL software, EDR and disk encryption audited
- [ ] Privileged local accounts, cached credentials, and remote access tooling reviewed
- [ ] Network device configs/secrets/firmware/AAA/TACACS/RADIUS reviewed
- [ ] IoT/OT inventory, segmentation, default credentials, and fail-safe behavior reviewed
- [ ] Physical access / RFID / badge systems are documentation only unless explicit RoE

## Probe adjustment (embedded × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
