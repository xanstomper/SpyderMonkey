# Per-domain decisive tests — the compromise battery — api / high-priv

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/universal-coverage.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-universal-coverage-per-domain-decisive-tests-t.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **api** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: strike the JSON body + query string; content-type and parameter placement change the probe shape
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

The checklists above are the audit pass. THIS is the exploitation pass: for every
U-domain, the decisive tests that prove actual control on authorized targets.
Each is minimal, read-only or one-request, documented-PoC adaptation only (§15).
Score §14 before running; ledger every negative with its exact test. A positive
triggers OP-ESCALATE (hunt the consumer) immediately.

## Probe adjustment (api × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
