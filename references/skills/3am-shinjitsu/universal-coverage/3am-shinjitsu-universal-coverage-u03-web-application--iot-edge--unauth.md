# U03 Web application — iot-edge / unauth

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/universal-coverage.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-universal-coverage-u03-web-application.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**
- context: **iot-edge** · auth **unauth** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: device-adjacent runtime at the edge — own devices, lab network
- auth state: no credential material — the classic differential applies as-is; absent auth = the authn-bypass class

## The technique

- [ ] Routes, methods, authn/authz states, and tenant boundaries mapped
- [ ] Session lifecycle, cookie flags, CSRF, CORS, CSP, and redirects reviewed
- [ ] Server-side authorization proven with two authorized test identities
- [ ] File upload/import/export and parser boundaries reviewed
- [ ] Business-logic invariants and abuse cases documented

## Probe adjustment (iot-edge × unauth)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
