# U11 Email & collaboration — container / machine

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/universal-coverage.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-universal-coverage-u11-email-collaboration.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-09** · **CWE-350** · **ATT&CK T1584**
- context: **container** · auth **machine** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-smtp-commands`, `nmap-smtp-enum-users`, `swaks`, `dig-mx`, `dig-txt`
- chains: `mail-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: namespace/capability surface — read-only inventory, no escape execution
- auth state: the principal is a SERVICE identity (API key, SA token, CI secret, webhook signing key): the differential is the KEY's resource scope — key-level vs user-level objects, cross-tenant reach, unscoped keys, and which audit trail the key leaves; the human account model does not apply

## The technique

- [ ] MX/SPF/DKIM/DMARC/MTA-STS/TLS-RPT checked and aligned
- [ ] Mailbox/SaaS sharing links, external guests, helpdesk/reset trust reviewed
- [ ] Anti-phishing controls and reporting paths validated (documentation only unless RoE)
- [ ] Domain spoofing/lookalike domains and tenant takeover risks documented
- [ ] Audit logs and retention for collaboration platforms reviewed

## Probe adjustment (container × machine)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
