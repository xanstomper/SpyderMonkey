# U04 API & microservices — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/universal-coverage.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-universal-coverage-u04-api-microservices.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- [ ] OpenAPI/GraphQL/gRPC/WS schemas captured or reconstructed from public docs
- [ ] Object, function, tenant, and role authorization tested with owned accounts
- [ ] Mass assignment, type coercion, parser differentials, and IDOR classes assessed
- [ ] Rate limits keyed by identity/IP/route/tenant verified
- [ ] Service-to-service trust, tokens, replay, and audience validation reviewed

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
