# 9.7 Target-dead triage (score 60) — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-09-breach-osint.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-09-breach-osint-9-7-target-dead-triage.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- Ladder: `dig +short <host> @1.1.1.1` AND `@8.8.8.8` (both empty = global no-record) →
  `getent hosts` apex/www/api spread → wayback availability API → whois against the TLD
  registry (`whois -h whois.nic.<tld>`) → split registered-but-DNS-stripped (registrar hold/
  takedown — re-check later, baseline moot) from dropped (expired — engagement closed).
- A baselined target going dark IS a finding — report it as one.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
