# 9.5 PTR/whois funnel (score 65) — mail / high-priv

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-09-breach-osint.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-09-breach-osint-9-5-ptr-whois-funnel-s.md`
- bindings: **MASTG-RES** · **CWE-288** · **ATT&CK T1557**
- context: **mail** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-smtp-commands`, `nmap-smtp-enum-users`, `swaks`, `dig-mx`, `dig-txt`
- chains: `mail-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: spf/dkim/dmarc record surface — spoofing and spoofability live in the record math
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

- PTR-reverse EVERY infra IP, then whois every name in the funnel — panel boxes and vendor
  mail servers identify themselves. Unregistered-but-linked names = registration takeover
  executable same-day for the price of a domain.

## Probe adjustment (mail × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
