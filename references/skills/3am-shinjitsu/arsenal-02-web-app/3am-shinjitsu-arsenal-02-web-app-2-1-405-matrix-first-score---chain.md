# 2.1 405-matrix first (score 80, T≈2min) — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-02-web-app.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-02-web-app-2-1-405-matrix-first-score-.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- DECISIVE: for each discovered path: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} %{content_type}'
  -X <M> <path>` for M ∈ {GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS}
- CONFIRMED WHEN: 405 on GET + 200/400/422 on POST = POST-only surface the GET sweep missed.
- Pair with §3.10 POST-`{}` sweep: an endpoint can accept POST only.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
