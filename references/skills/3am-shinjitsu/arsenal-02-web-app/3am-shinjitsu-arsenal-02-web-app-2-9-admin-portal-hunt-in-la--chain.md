# 2.9 Admin-portal hunt in lazy chunks (score 85) — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-02-web-app.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-02-web-app-2-9-admin-portal-hunt-in-la.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- The main bundle holds the route table only. `grep -oE '"/api/admin/[a-z_/]+"' chunk.js` on
  EVERY chunk. Confirmed pattern: full `/api/admin/*` portal (user mgmt, grants, audit logs)
  invisible in main bundle → run the authz matrix on it (§3.3).

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
