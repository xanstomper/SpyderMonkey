# 2.2 Ghost-route discrimination (score 75 — kills false positives) — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-02-web-app.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-02-web-app-2-2-ghost-route-discriminat.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- RULE: status alone proves NOTHING on SPA/CDN deployments. Every path returns 200 text/html.
- REAL = `application/json` (or `text/event-stream`, `application/msgpack`).
- Cloudflare Access wall: `Sign in · Cloudflare Access` title on EVERY path incl. JSON APIs
  = WALL, not response. Record WALL for the phase; verdicts from a gated host are junk.
- Sensitive-file soft-404: identical `DOCTYPE html / charset=utf8 / viewport` 200 = absent.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
