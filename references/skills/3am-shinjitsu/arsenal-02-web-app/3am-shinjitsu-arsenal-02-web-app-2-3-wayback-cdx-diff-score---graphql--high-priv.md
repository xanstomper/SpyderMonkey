# 2.3 Wayback CDX diff (score 75, zero target traffic) — graphql / high-priv

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-02-web-app.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-02-web-app-2-3-wayback-cdx-diff-score-.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **graphql** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: aliases and batched queries bypass field-level checks; type confusion lives in the schema
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

- DECISIVE: `curl -s 'https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=<domain>/*&fl=original&collapse=urlkey'`
- EXTRACT: removed routes vs live; id-format oracle (`user=`, `token=`, `r=`, `stag=` shapes);
  removed auth methods; old affiliate formats. Run BEFORE brute-formatting any id oracle.

## Probe adjustment (graphql × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
