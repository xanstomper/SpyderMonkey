# 2.5 Source maps (score 90 when present) — mesh / federated

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-02-web-app.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-02-web-app-2-5-source-maps-score-90-wh.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CRYPTO-04** · **CWE-329** · **ATT&CK T1573**
- context: **mesh** · auth **federated** · chain role **final**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: service-mesh sidecar surface — own mesh, read-only mTLS posture
- auth state: identity rides an external IdP (OAuth/OIDC/SAML/SSO): the differential is the TOKEN — audience, issuer, redirect_uri, scope downgrades, code/state reuse, and the exchange at the resource server; the local session may be fine while the trust boundary is not

## The technique

- DECISIVE: append `.map` to every fetched bundle/chunk; HTTP 200 + JSON = full source recovery.
- CONFIRMED WHEN: original TS/JS with comments, server-only constants, internal endpoints.

## Probe adjustment (mesh × federated)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- the impact leg — shukaku prices what this rung reaches
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
