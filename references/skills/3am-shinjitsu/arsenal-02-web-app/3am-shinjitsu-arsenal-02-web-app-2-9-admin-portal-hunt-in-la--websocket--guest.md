# 2.9 Admin-portal hunt in lazy chunks (score 85) — websocket / guest

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-02-web-app.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-02-web-app-2-9-admin-portal-hunt-in-la.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **websocket** · auth **guest** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: state carries across frames — the replay/state-bypass classes apply frame-to-frame
- auth state: a filter/WAF tier fronts the target: expect canonicalization and signature matching on the raw request — the probe vocabulary's encodings (double-encode, unicode, backslash, case-split) exist exactly for this tier; the differential must clear the filter WITHOUT tripping it, or the finding is a WAF flag, not a class confirmation. Low-and-slow: one variant per request, never a burst.

## The technique

- The main bundle holds the route table only. `grep -oE '"/api/admin/[a-z_/]+"' chunk.js` on
  EVERY chunk. Confirmed pattern: full `/api/admin/*` portal (user mgmt, grants, audit logs)
  invisible in main bundle → run the authz matrix on it (§3.3).

## Probe adjustment (websocket × guest)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
