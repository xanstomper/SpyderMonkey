# 2.2 Ghost-route discrimination (score 75 — kills false positives) — host / service

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-02-web-app.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-02-web-app-2-2-ghost-route-discriminat.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL** · **CWE-200** · **ATT&CK T1005**
- context: **host** · auth **service** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `s3scanner`, `cloudbrute`, `cloudlist`, `kube-hunter`, `shodan`
- chains: `cloud-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: era-stack banner mapping (kaisha cve) before any rung
- auth state: a daemon/listener identity — the probe targets what the service can see and invoke, not what a human session can

## The technique

- RULE: status alone proves NOTHING on SPA/CDN deployments. Every path returns 200 text/html.
- REAL = `application/json` (or `text/event-stream`, `application/msgpack`).
- Cloudflare Access wall: `Sign in · Cloudflare Access` title on EVERY path incl. JSON APIs
  = WALL, not response. Record WALL for the phase; verdicts from a gated host are junk.
- Sensitive-file soft-404: identical `DOCTYPE html / charset=utf8 / viewport` 200 = absent.

## Probe adjustment (host × service)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
