# 2.12 Cache/Web poison quick test (score 55) — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-02-web-app.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-02-web-app-2-12-cache-web-poison-quick.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- DECISIVE: one request with unkeyed header (`X-Forwarded-Host: evil.com`) on a cacheable path;
  re-fetch plain from another vantage within TTL.
- CONFIRMED WHEN: poisoned content served to the plain fetch. Owned infra: revert = purge.
- FP: CDN strips the header (common) — negative, ledger it.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
