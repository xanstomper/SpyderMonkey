# T+40 — decision point

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-index.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

Every probe above → ledger entry (`campaign-state.json`). Re-score. Remaining time goes to
the highest-Score' hypothesis from `arsenal-03` (API) and `arsenal-04` (auth), NOT to
wordlist spraying. Exhausted class = N/A'd with the exact test string, never re-probed.
