# 6.1 Bucket/backup enumeration (score 85) — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-06-infra-hosting.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-06-infra-hosting-6-1-bucket-backup-enu.md`
- chain role: **entry — this OPENS a chain: everything after pairs with it; chain detect looks for same-origin findings that follow**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- NAME FAMILIES: `<target>`, `<target>-backup`, `backup-<target>`, `<target>-prod`,
  `<brand>-assets`, `<target>-static`, `s3-<target>`, `<target>.s3.<region>` on S3/GCS/Azure.
- GRADATION: listing (anon GET /) > read > write. Write-probe = FORBIDDEN unless owned
  (revert-map first). Listing+read on sensitive prefixes = CONFIRMED data-at-reach.
- VERIFY BEFORE VERDICT: an exposed archive is a dump only after it's been opened — download,
  `file`, listing, sample (PII minimality). Identical soft-404 shell = absent (§2.2).

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
