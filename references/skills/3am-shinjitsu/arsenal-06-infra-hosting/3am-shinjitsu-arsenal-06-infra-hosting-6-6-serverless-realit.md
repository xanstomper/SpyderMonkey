# 6.6 Serverless reality check (score 30 → pivot immediately)

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- No filesystem, no process, no persistence surface = state it ONCE in the ledger and pivot
  to event/state planes: Workers KV/D1/R2 via misrouted routes, Lambda env-var secrets via
  error pages, queue poison-pill classes (read-only), durable-object cross-tenant id prediction.

## Family use

- decisive-test shape lives in the source canon
- walls: validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
