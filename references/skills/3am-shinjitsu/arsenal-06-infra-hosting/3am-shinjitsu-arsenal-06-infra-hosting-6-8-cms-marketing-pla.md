# 6.8 CMS/marketing plane (score 65)

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-06-infra-hosting.md`

## Route

- probes: `wpscan`, `cmseek`, `droopescan`, `cmsmap`, `nmap-wp-plugins`, `nmap-drupal-enum`
- chains: `cms-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- Leaked delivery token (bundle/CMS ref) → scan EVERY entry field for `https?://` — CMS
  content is a SUPERSET of the bundle for hostnames (preview/dev hosts the JS never names).
- prod-on-RC environments, Contentful/Prismic space enumeration from one token.
- WordPress: `wordpress-cloudflare-origin-bypass.md` recipe — direct-origin + `_embed` author
  slug enum + `wp_ajax_nopriv_*` sweep + maintenance-auth-oracle discriminator.
