# 3.4 Mass-assignment (score 80) — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-03-api.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-03-api-3-4-mass-assignment-score-80.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- DECISIVE: signup/write with `data:{role:"admin",is_admin:true,tier:"enterprise",balance:999999}`.
- THE GATE (3 targets confirmed negative): persistence into `user_metadata`/JWT ≠ escalation.
  Exploitability = does ANY backend authorize on the planted key? Check the real table read +
  RLS `auth.jwt()->>'sub'` scoping + DTO discard. Persisted-but-untrusted = hardening note ~55.
- PostgREST UPDATE discriminator: 204 ≠ rows changed — send
  `Prefer: return=representation,count=exact`, read `content-range: */0` = ZERO rows. INSERT
  blocks = `42501`.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
