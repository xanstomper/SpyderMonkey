# 3.9 Strict-validator field enumeration (score 70) — web-app / unauth

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-03-api.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-03-api-3-9-strict-validator-field-enum.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-INFO** · **CWE-200** · **ATT&CK T1592**
- context: **web-app** · auth **unauth** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: strike through the browser/proxy path; the 3-gate differential runs on the reflected/accepted value
- auth state: no credential material — the classic differential applies as-is; absent auth = the authn-bypass class

## The technique

- One valid-minimal body + ONE wrong-typed guess per request: `er_field_validation_<name>` /
  Pydantic `loc` names the failing field → that param is REAL. Silent 201 = ignored/loosely
  validated (retest truthy `"x"` as `true`). ~30-guess pass maps the whole filter vocabulary.

## Probe adjustment (web-app × unauth)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
