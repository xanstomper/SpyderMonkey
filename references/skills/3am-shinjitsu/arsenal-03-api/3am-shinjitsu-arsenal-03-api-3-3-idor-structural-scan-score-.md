# 3.3 IDOR structural scan (score 85)

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- From §3.2 shapes: every cross-user identifier (`walletId`, `ownerId`, `userId`, `accountId`).
- DECISIVE: operator's own two accounts (or one ephemeral self-account) — swap ONLY the id,
  keep the valid session. Cross-account read/write = CONFIRMED.
- Numeric-id ladders on admin routes: `/users/1` `/grants/1` unauth + low-priv (GET then
  PATCH as own-id). All 401/403 uniform = negative.
