# 3.7 Rate-limiter scope/keying (score 75, ceiling 15/endpoint, once) — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-03-api.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-03-api-3-7-rate-limiter-scope-keying-s.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- Map: keying (IP/email/account/global), decay, window. Tests: 10-rapid sequential; HPP dup
  (`?a=1&a=1`); dual-stack (v6 pool vs v4); malformed-payload counting (do 400s consume?).
- Self-DoS law: 429'd attempts usually COUNT — a fast retry loop keeps the bucket drained
  forever. After a burst go FULL-COLD 2h, then ONE attempt. Read `retry-after` + margin.
- CF challenge pacing: IP-wide ~12-burst → 403/429 EVERY endpoint ~75s. Space 3-4s; re-read
  the SAME endpoint after decay before calling it gated.
- CONFIRMED: unthrottled code/token-exchange (zero 429 on 15-20 garbage inputs) + short
  entropy + long TTL = the Holy-Shit shape (entropy sizing: §4.5).

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
