# 4.7 SSO anchors (score 65, fingerprint-first) — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-04-auth-identity.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-04-auth-identity-4-7-sso-anchors-score.md`
- chain role: **entry — this OPENS a chain: everything after pairs with it; chain detect looks for same-origin findings that follow**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- SAML: signature wrapping, assertion replay, audience restriction. OIDC: nonce/state
  validation, token-exchange abuse, consent-phishing surface. SCIM: over-scoped tokens,
  bulk enumeration. LDAP/Kerberos classes from vector-matrix N (owned infra).
- Capture the FULL external-IdP authorize URL before touching the form (realm/return_to/
  ticket, loginN infra series).

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
