# 4.1 GoTrue/Supabase chain (score 90 — THE standard ladder) — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-04-auth-identity.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-04-auth-identity-4-1-gotrue-supabase-c.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-smtp-commands`, `nmap-smtp-enum-users`, `swaks`, `dig-mx`, `dig-txt`
- chains: `mail-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- FINGERPRINT: `www-authenticate: Basic realm="service"` + `x-kong-response-latency` +
  `x-kong-request-id` + ACAH contains `apikey` = Kong-fronted Supabase.
- 1. Mine anon key from bundles: `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY:` (itself an HS256 JWT `role:anon`).
- 2. `GET /auth/v1/settings` + `/auth/v1/health` WITH `apikey: <anon>` = providers, autoconfirm
  (email/phone), disable_signup, sms_provider, GoTrue version. Everything 401 without it.
- 3. Signup with planted privilege keys (§3.4 mass-assignment gate — persistence ≠ trust).
- 4. Email-confirm end-to-end (self-bootstrapped, no operator creds): public-inbox API
  (mailinator `/api/v2/domains/public/inboxes/<u>` → `/messages/<id>`; harakirimail
  `/api/v1/inbox/<n>` → `/api/v1/email/<_id>` → `bodyhtmltext`) → regex `token=([a-f0-9]{40,})`
  → consume ONCE via `GET /auth/v1/verify?token=...&type=signup&email=...` (303 → capture
  `#access_token=...&refresh_token=...` from `%{redirect_url}` fragment — one-time).
  JSON `POST /auth/v1/verify` may reject VALID tokens (`otp_expired`) — use the GET route.
- 5. Decode JWT: does `user_metadata.role` survive into claims? Then the §3.4 trust gate.
- 6. Confirm-email `redirect_to` param = mirror-host leak (Lovable.app mirrors etc.).
- Signup persists unconfirmed row (`role:authenticated`, blocked only by `email_not_confirmed`)
  = LOW unless a post-confirm API trusts `aud` without `email_verified`.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
