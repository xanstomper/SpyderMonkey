# 4.10 Auth-chain rate sweep (score 75) — chain composition

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- The WHOLE chain, not just login: `/auth/v1/verify`, handoff exchange, token code brute,
  forgot-password, resend-verification (no captcha + no limit = mail-bomb pump vector even
  with uniform no-enumeration responses). One working limiter (signup 60s) proves nothing
  about the others. 15-26 rapid garbage inputs per endpoint, `-w '%{http_code}'`, once.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
