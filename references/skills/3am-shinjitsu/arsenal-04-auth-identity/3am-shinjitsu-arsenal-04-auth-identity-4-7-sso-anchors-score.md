## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- SAML: signature wrapping, assertion replay, audience restriction. OIDC: nonce/state
  validation, token-exchange abuse, consent-phishing surface. SCIM: over-scoped tokens,
  bulk enumeration. LDAP/Kerberos classes from vector-matrix N (owned infra).
- Capture the FULL external-IdP authorize URL before touching the form (realm/return_to/
  ticket, loginN infra series).

## Family use

- decisive-test shape lives in the source canon
- walls: validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
