# 10.3 Playground-proxy auth bypass (score 90)

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-10-llm-ai.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- generated: 2026-11-07

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- SPA "try it" playgrounds expose INTERNAL proxies skipping the public API-key gate.
- DECISIVE: fetch playground HTML → grep `fetch\(` for proxy paths → sweep `/pg/*`,
  `/api/playground/*`, `/demo/*`, `/internal/*` → 502 `upstream_unavailable` = auth PASSED
  (iterate provider prefixes before concluding); burst-rate the PROXY specifically.
