# 10.6 Bounded-burn sizing (score 70, OWNED gateways) — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-10-llm-ai.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-10-llm-ai-10-6-bounded-burn-sizing-sco.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- count_tokens/no-limit endpoints = free CPU-DoS primitive: big body → burst → parallel.
  MEASURE: single 2.5M-token body 3.27s CPU; 10× parallel 1M-token = 7-10s each. Extrapolate
  $/hr exposure from the measurement. Fix: per-key limit + input cap.
- 429-vs-401 discriminator: quota-exhausted key → 429 naming reset ts = key live + quota
  model leak, zero spend.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
