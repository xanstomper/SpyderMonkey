# 7.2 Abandoned deps (score 70) — wasm / high-priv

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-07-supply-chain.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-07-supply-chain-7-2-abandoned-deps-sco.md`
- bindings: **MASTG-RES** · **CWE-288** · **ATT&CK T1557**
- context: **wasm** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: sandbox internals — memory/import surface, own compiled artifact only
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

- Bundle imports of unmaintained libs (last release >2y) with known CVE classes; dead CDN
  scripts (→ §5.6 hijackable references); `@deprecated` admin scaffolding left deployed.
- DECISIVE: version pin in lockfile/bundle header → advisory cross-check.

## Probe adjustment (wasm × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
