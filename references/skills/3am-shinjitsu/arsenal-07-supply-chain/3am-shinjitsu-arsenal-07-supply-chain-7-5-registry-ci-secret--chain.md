# 7.5 Registry/CI secret exposure (score 85 when found) — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-07-supply-chain.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-07-supply-chain-7-5-registry-ci-secret.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- Public repo/paste scan of org namespace for keys (`sk_`, `eyJ` JWT shapes, `AKIA`),
  workflow logs, committed `.env` history (git log on public clones).
- A leaked key = a FINDING, not a license: one read-only privilege confirmation (`/v1/credits`
  class balance endpoint), then documentation (§2 scope gate).

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
