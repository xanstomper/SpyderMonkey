# 5.8 Service worker / cache-asset poisoning (score 55) — edge / high-priv

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-05-client-side.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-05-client-side-5-8-service-worker-cach.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**
- context: **edge** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: rate/segmentation differences — masscan-class first, then the app layer
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

- SW registration scope, cache-first strategies on hashed assets; asset-URL injection points.
- Clickjacking: missing XFO/frame-ancestors on state-changing pages.

## Probe adjustment (edge × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
