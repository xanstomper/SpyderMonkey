# 5.1 postMessage origin matrix (score 70) — chain composition

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-05-client-side.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-05-client-side-5-1-postmessage-origin-.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- VULN: `postMessage(data, '*')` / attacker-origin targets; receive-side without origin check.
- CORRECT (no false alarm): `postMessage(data, window.location.origin)` on send; sender-origin
  validation on receive.
- DECISIVE: static grep every chunk for `postMessage(`; dynamic harness only on confirmed
  wildcards.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
