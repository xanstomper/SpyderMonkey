# 5.5 Stored XSS in trusted UI (score 85, validation only) — graphql / expired

- source canon: `3am-shinjitsu/arsenal-05-client-side.md`
- base technique: `3am-shinjitsu-arsenal-05-client-side-5-5-stored-xss-in-trust.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-SESS** · **CWE-384** · **ATT&CK T1550**
- context: **graphql** · auth **expired** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `dalfox`, `xsstrike`, `xsser`
- chains: `web`, `api`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: aliases and batched queries bypass field-level checks; type confusion lives in the schema
- auth state: the credential/session has lapsed — the class probes reuse, reactivation, and the no-revoke gap

## The technique

- Only on CONFIRMED injection points, in-scope, dalfox allowed; payloads minimal, self-owned
  accounts; evidence = reflected execution in the operator's own session, screenshot + path.
- Sinks: `innerHTML`, `eval`, `document.write`, postMessage targets, markdown renderers.

## Probe adjustment (graphql × expired)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
