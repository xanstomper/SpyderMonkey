## The technique

- A doc page TITLE is a display name; the real route lives inside the OpenAPI JSON
  (operationId/slug ≠ path, e.g. a page named "Get Listed Items" has path
  `/trading/...`). Never guess paths from page names — read the JSON.
- Docs SPAs return an empty shell (`<title>Found. Redirecting...</title>`, ~32-byte body)
  to plain curl — the `.md` endpoints are the reliable entry, not the HTML pages.
- crt.sh rate-limits with an HTML page (starts `[BEGIN_HEADERS]`) instead of JSON — catch
  the parse error and back off; never treat that HTML as a live result.
- A "blocked" response from a docs `/api/*` path proves nothing about the API itself — it
  is the same WAF surface; classify it with the differential ladder before concluding.
