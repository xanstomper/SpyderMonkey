# Evidence chain — chain composition

- source canon: `kaisha/ladder-playbook.md`
- base technique: `kaisha-ladder-playbook-evidence-chain.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

Every rung: `SOURCE (confirmed access) → RUNG (id/class) → TEST (exact) →
PROOF (NO-GAIN shape) → STATUS`. A rung without a test is a guess; a proof
without a rung is a fabrication. Drift: re-verify rungs older than the window
before citing.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
