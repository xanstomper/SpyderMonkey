# R1 — identity inventory (read-only) — kubernetes / machine

- source canon: `kaisha/ladder-playbook.md`
- base technique: `kaisha-ladder-playbook-r1-identity-inventory-read-only.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-04** · **CWE-530** · **ATT&CK T1552**
- context: **kubernetes** · auth **machine** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: RBAC/service-account surface — read-only enumeration, crown the exposure
- auth state: the principal is a SERVICE identity (API key, SA token, CI secret, webhook signing key): the differential is the KEY's resource scope — key-level vs user-level objects, cross-tenant reach, unscoped keys, and which audit trail the key leaves; the human account model does not apply

## The technique

- whoami-class: current principal, groups count (descriptions only)
- key files: `~/.ssh/` count + fingerprints (never private material)
- env markers: count of credential-bearing vars (names only)

## Probe adjustment (kubernetes × machine)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
