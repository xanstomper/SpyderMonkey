## The technique

| Rung | Class | The ONE decisive test | Wall |
|---|---|---|---|
| R4a | sudo misconfig | `sudo -l` → match documented NO_PASSWD/safe-echo classes | listed, never executed for gain |
| R4b | SUID/cred-file | SUID + world-readable cred inventory (counts) | paths only, never contents |
| R4c | token/key-reuse | inventory → reuse-check against OWN second host | one shot, reversed |
| R4d | unit/path-trust | systemd unit + PATH inventory → trust classes | read-only, no modification |

## Family use

- decisive-test shape lives in the source canon
- walls: validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
