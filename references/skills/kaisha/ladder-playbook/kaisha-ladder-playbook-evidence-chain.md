# Evidence chain

- source canon: `kaisha/ladder-playbook.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-INFO** · **CWE-200** · **ATT&CK T1592**
- generated: 2026-11-04

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

Every rung: `SOURCE (confirmed access) → RUNG (id/class) → TEST (exact) →
PROOF (NO-GAIN shape) → STATUS`. A rung without a test is a guess; a proof
without a rung is a fabrication. Drift: re-verify rungs older than the window
before citing.

## Family use

- decisive-test shape lives in the source canon
- walls: validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
