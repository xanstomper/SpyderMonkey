# R5 — lateral (the top of the ladder)

- source canon: `kaisha/ladder-playbook.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- generated: 2026-11-04

## Route

- probes: `nmap-http-backup`, `nmap-robots`, `nmap-sitemap`, `snallygaster`, `wget-mirror`, `httrack`, `gau`, `git-dumper`, `trufflehog`, `gitleaks`
- chains: `exposure-sweep`, `content`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- Basis: the harvest register's CRED rows + documented reuse classes
  (flaw 10 entropy/forge · seam C auth<->backend-binding)
- The plan: `from → to` on OWN declared hosts only; ONE validation shot each,
  reversed; on CONFIRM the new vantage feeds shukaku (reason → hunt → crown).

## Family use

- decisive-test shape lives in the source canon
- walls: validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
