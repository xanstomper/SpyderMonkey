# The hardware kit (what a real engagement node carries) — chain composition

- source canon: `spydermonkey/hardware-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-hardware-canon-the-hardware-kit-what-a-real-eng.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `nmap`, `masscan`, `naabu`, `zmap`, `nc`, `fping`, `nmap-allports`
- chains: `net`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

USB-UART (CP2102/CH340-class), logic analyzer (OpenBench/Saleae-class), SOIC-8
flash clip, Bus Pirate/FT2232H, HackRF/RTL-SDR dongles, ubertooth One,
Proxmark3 Easy, NFC reader, ESP32 dev boards + the operator's own devices
(strips, plugs, badge). RF enclosure for tx work. All of it lab inventory;
nothing ships to a third-party engagement target without scope authority
explicitly naming the device/network.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
