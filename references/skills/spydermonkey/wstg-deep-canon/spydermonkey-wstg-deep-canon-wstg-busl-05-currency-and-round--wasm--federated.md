# WSTG-BUSL-05 Currency and Rounding — wasm / federated

- source canon: `spydermonkey/wstg-deep-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-wstg-deep-canon-wstg-busl-05-currency-and-round.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHZ-04** · **CWE-639** · **ATT&CK T1068**
- context: **wasm** · auth **federated** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: sandbox internals — memory/import surface, own compiled artifact only
- auth state: identity rides an external IdP (OAuth/OIDC/SAML/SSO): the differential is the TOKEN — audience, issuer, redirect_uri, scope downgrades, code/state reuse, and the exchange at the resource server; the local session may be fine while the trust boundary is not

## The technique

- class: rounding direction, currency confusion
- probe: boundary quantities on the lab replica; the math differential is the proof
- wall: lab replica

## Probe adjustment (wasm × federated)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
