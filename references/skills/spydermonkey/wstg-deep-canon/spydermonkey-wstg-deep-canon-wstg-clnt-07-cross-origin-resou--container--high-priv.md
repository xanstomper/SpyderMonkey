# WSTG-CLNT-07 Cross Origin Resource Sharing — container / high-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/wstg-deep-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-wstg-deep-canon-wstg-clnt-07-cross-origin-resou.md`
- bindings: **PTES-PE** · **CWE-522** · **ATT&CK T1555**
- context: **container** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **final**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: namespace/capability surface — read-only inventory, no escape execution
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

- class: ACAO: * with credentials, reflected origins
- probe: Origin header differentials on the lab replica
- wall: read-only headers

## Probe adjustment (container × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- the impact leg — shukaku prices what this rung reaches
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
