# WSTG-APIT-02 Rate Limiting — chain composition

- source canon: `spydermonkey/wstg-deep-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-wstg-deep-canon-wstg-apit-02-rate-limiting.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-slowloris-check`, `curl`
- chains: `web`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- class: missing/naive rate limits
- probe: 3-request timing differential on the lab replica — the limit SHAPE, never a flood
- wall: proof is the missing counter, not an outage

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
