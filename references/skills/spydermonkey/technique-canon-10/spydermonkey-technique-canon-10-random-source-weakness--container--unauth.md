# Random-source weakness — container / unauth

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-10.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-10-random-source-weakness.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-01** · **CWE-681** · **ATT&CK T1565**
- context: **container** · auth **unauth** · chain role **final**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: namespace/capability surface — read-only inventory, no escape execution
- auth state: no credential material — the classic differential applies as-is; absent auth = the authn-bypass class

## The technique

Math.random/java.util.Random generating security tokens. Decisive test: token sequence prediction from sampled outputs on your build = the finding.

## Probe adjustment (container × unauth)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- the impact leg — shukaku prices what this rung reaches
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
