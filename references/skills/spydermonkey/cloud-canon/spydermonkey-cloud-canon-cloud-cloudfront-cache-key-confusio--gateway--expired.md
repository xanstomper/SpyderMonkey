# Cloud CloudFront Cache Key Confusion (CLOUD-EDGE-02) — gateway / expired

- source canon: `spydermonkey/cloud-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-cloud-canon-cloud-cloudfront-cache-key-confusio.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ADV-01** · **CWE-444** · **ATT&CK T1190**
- context: **gateway** · auth **expired** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `s3scanner`, `cloudbrute`, `cloudlist`, `kube-hunter`, `shodan`
- chains: `cloud-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: api/front-door tier — routing and authn decisions here are the differential
- auth state: the credential/session has lapsed — the class probes reuse, reactivation, and the no-revoke gap

## The technique

- class: unkeyed headers/params changing the cached object
- probe: lab replica — the caching differential with harmless markers
- wall: lab only; prod cache is never poisoned

## Probe adjustment (gateway × expired)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
