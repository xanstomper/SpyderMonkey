# Cloud Azure AD App Registration Overreach (CLOUD-AZ-03) — aws / high-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/cloud-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-cloud-canon-cloud-azure-ad-app-registration-ove.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CRYPTO-04** · **CWE-329** · **ATT&CK T1573**
- context: **aws** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: IAM/identity surface — read-only enumeration (shukaku hunt semantics)
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

- class: app registrations with excessive delegated/application grants
- probe: read-only grants inventory of the declared tenant
- wall: read-only

## Probe adjustment (aws × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
