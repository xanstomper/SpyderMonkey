# Delivery & spoof classes — chain composition

- source canon: `spydermonkey/mail-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-mail-canon-delivery-spoof-classes.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-http-backup`, `nmap-robots`, `nmap-sitemap`, `snallygaster`, `wget-mirror`, `httrack`, `gau`, `git-dumper`, `trufflehog`, `gitleaks`
- chains: `exposure-sweep`, `content`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

| Probe | Test | Confirmed-when |
|---|---|---|
| Spoof test | `swaks` from own domain to own mailbox | SPF/DKIM/DMARC verdict |
| Lookalike domains | `dnstwist --registered` on own brand | registered lookalikes |
| Typosquat take | `can-i-take-over-xyz` on lookalike | dangling mx/cname |
| Bimi icon | own logo file check | brand abuse surface |
| Google/outlook postmaster | deliverability report (own domain) | spam score data |

Walls: enumeration and probe traffic target the operator's own mail estate.
Auth brute only against accounts the operator controls (their own). No
harvesting, no credential theft from third parties — ever.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
