# OAuth implicit-flow token leakage — chain composition

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-oauth-implicit-flow-token-leaka.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

Implicit flow puts the access token in the URL fragment, which leaks via referrer and history. Decisive test: register a redirect_uri under your control in a dev client (or find the fragment echoed in any in-scope page), and observe `access_token` in the fragment path — proof is the fragment reaching a second-party surface. Crown: token lifetime + scope carried by the leak.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
