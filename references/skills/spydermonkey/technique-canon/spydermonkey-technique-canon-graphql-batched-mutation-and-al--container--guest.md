# GraphQL batched-mutation and alias abuse — container / guest

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-graphql-batched-mutation-and-al.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-APIT-10** · **CWE-1321** · **ATT&CK T1190**
- context: **container** · auth **guest** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-slowloris-check`, `curl`
- chains: `web`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: namespace/capability surface — read-only inventory, no escape execution
- auth state: a filter/WAF tier fronts the target: expect canonicalization and signature matching on the raw request — the probe vocabulary's encodings (double-encode, unicode, backslash, case-split) exist exactly for this tier; the differential must clear the filter WITHOUT tripping it, or the finding is a WAF flag, not a class confirmation. Low-and-slow: one variant per request, never a burst.

## The technique

Batched operations/aliases bypass per-field rate logic. Decisive test: 10 aliased identical mutations in one request on a test object — 10 executions = the class.

## Probe adjustment (container × guest)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
