# Rate-limit key rotation (X-Forwarded-For trust) — chain composition

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-rate-limit-key-rotation-x-forwa.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

Limits keyed on a client-supplied header = limit-free access. Decisive test: same request 6× with rotating X-Forwarded-For — all 200 past the documented limit = the class (the arithmetic, not a brute).

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
