# Currency and price-mismatch substitution — chain composition

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-currency-and-price-mismatch-sub.md`
- chain role: **final — this CLOSES a chain: shukaku prices what it reaches; chain detect looks for the entries that feed it**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

A client-supplied currency code (or price object) re-priced by the server at a stale rate is a rounding/repricing seam. Decisive test: switch currency mid-checkout and diff the converted line prices against the live FX the page displays — persistent mismatch = the finding.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
