## The technique

Min-withdrawal/fee logic enforced client-side (button disable, computed fee in JS) while the API accepts the raw request. Decisive test: submit the raw withdrawal POST for 1 cent below threshold on a test account — acceptance = the class; the payload is never the point, the server's acceptance is.
