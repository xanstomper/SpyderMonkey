## The technique

Hidden/ignored client fields (`price`, `discount`, `unitPrice`) that the serializer re-binds into the order. Decisive test: add price=1 to the POST body; a changed order total without a server-side entitlement check is the class. NEVER submit the poisoned order — the preview response is the proof (no-gain).
