# SQLi ORDER BY / second-order

## Route

- probes: `sqlmap`, `nosqlmap`, `tplmap`, `commix`, `crlfuzz`, `dotdotpwn`, `nmap-http-sqli`, `nmap-shellshock`
- chains: `fuzz`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

ORDER BY injection (no UNION needed) and second-order (payload stored, executed in another query) are the two shapes scanners miss. Decisive test: ORDER BY (CASE WHEN 1=1 THEN col ELSE col2 END) — row-order delta = injectable; second-order requires your own stored payload re-read in the admin/profile render.
