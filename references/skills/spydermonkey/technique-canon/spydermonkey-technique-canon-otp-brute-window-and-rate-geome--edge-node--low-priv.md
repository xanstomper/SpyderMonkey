# OTP brute window and rate geometry — edge-node / low-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-otp-brute-window-and-rate-geome.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN-09** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **edge-node** · auth **low-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-slowloris-check`, `curl`
- chains: `web`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: cdn/origin edge — cache key and origin-pull trust are the class surface
- auth state: hold ONE low-priv principal; swap object ids/roles upward only (idor/authz classes)

## The technique

OTP validation with per-request cost < lockout threshold is enumerable (6-digit, 10 tries/lockout, no window reset = 1-in-10000 per lockout cycle). Decisive test: measure the exact counters — wrong-OTP responses until lock, lock TTL, and whether attempts decrement on resend. Register the arithmetic; never extract a live OTP.

## Probe adjustment (edge-node × low-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
