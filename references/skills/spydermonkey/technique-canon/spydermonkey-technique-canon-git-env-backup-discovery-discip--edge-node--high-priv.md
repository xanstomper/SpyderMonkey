# .git /.env /backup discovery discipline — edge-node / high-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-git-env-backup-discovery-discip.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-04** · **CWE-530** · **ATT&CK T1552**
- context: **edge-node** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **entry**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: cdn/origin edge — cache key and origin-pull trust are the class surface
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

Distinguish SPA-fallback 200 shells from REAL exposure: require content distinct from the canonical nonexistent-path control (size/content-type delta). Decisive test: control path vs candidate path — identical shell = exhausted, different = the finding.

## Probe adjustment (edge-node × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- opens the kill chain (first blood) — pairs with the info/harvest/recon findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
