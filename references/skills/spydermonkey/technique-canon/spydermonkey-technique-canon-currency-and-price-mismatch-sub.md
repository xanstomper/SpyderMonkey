## Route

- probes: `nmap-slowloris-check`, `curl`
- chains: `web`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

A client-supplied currency code (or price object) re-priced by the server at a stale rate is a rounding/repricing seam. Decisive test: switch currency mid-checkout and diff the converted line prices against the live FX the page displays — persistent mismatch = the finding.
