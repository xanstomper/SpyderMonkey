# Coupon stacking and chain arithmetic — chain composition

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-coupon-stacking-and-chain-arith.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

Multiple discount codes applied per cart (or a code re-applied per item) is arithmetic the server should refuse. Decisive test: apply code A then B — final total below the item floor = the class; capture the order-preview JSON before/after as baseline/attack/diff.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
