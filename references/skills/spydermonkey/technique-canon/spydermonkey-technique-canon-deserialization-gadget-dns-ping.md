# Deserialization gadget DNS-ping

## The technique

The safe proof of a deserialization class is a DNS-only gadget (no command execution). Decisive test: serialized payload whose gadget list ends in a DNS resolution to your domain — the lookup arrival is the finding. Execution gadgets are REPORTED as the class, never fired.
