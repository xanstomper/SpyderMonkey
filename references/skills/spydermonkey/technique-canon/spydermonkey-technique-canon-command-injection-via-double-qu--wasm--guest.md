# Command injection via double-quote/pipe variants — wasm / guest

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-command-injection-via-double-qu.md`
- bindings: **MASTG-RES** · **CWE-288** · **ATT&CK T1557**
- context: **wasm** · auth **guest** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `sqlmap`, `nosqlmap`, `tplmap`, `commix`, `crlfuzz`, `dotdotpwn`, `nmap-http-sqli`, `nmap-shellshock`
- chains: `fuzz`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: sandbox internals — memory/import surface, own compiled artifact only
- auth state: a filter/WAF tier fronts the target: expect canonicalization and signature matching on the raw request — the probe vocabulary's encodings (double-encode, unicode, backslash, case-split) exist exactly for this tier; the differential must clear the filter WITHOUT tripping it, or the finding is a WAF flag, not a class confirmation. Low-and-slow: one variant per request, never a burst.

## The technique

The documented class vocabulary (backtick, $( ), newline, %0a) applied ONE variant per request. Decisive test: an out-of-band marker (DNS to your registered domain) beats response-diff for blind injection — the marker arrival is the proof.

## Probe adjustment (wasm × guest)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
