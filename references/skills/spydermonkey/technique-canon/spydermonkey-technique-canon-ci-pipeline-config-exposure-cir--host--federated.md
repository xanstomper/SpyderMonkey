# CI pipeline config exposure (.circleci/.github workflows) — host / federated

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-ci-pipeline-config-exposure-cir.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-04** · **CWE-538** · **ATT&CK T1552**
- context: **host** · auth **federated** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: era-stack banner mapping (kaisha cve) before any rung
- auth state: identity rides an external IdP (OAuth/OIDC/SAML/SSO): the differential is the TOKEN — audience, issuer, redirect_uri, scope downgrades, code/state reuse, and the exchange at the resource server; the local session may be fine while the trust boundary is not

## The technique

Runner configs with secrets referenced (not values) map the secret inventory. Decisive test: workflow YAML naming secrets + the pull-request trigger surface = the supply-chain finding.

## Probe adjustment (host × federated)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
