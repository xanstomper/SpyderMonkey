# SSO single-logout non-propagation — chain composition

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-sso-single-logout-non-propagati.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

Logout at the SP that leaves the IdP session (or a sibling SP) alive turns "logout" into a UI state. Decisive test: log out at SP-A, replay SP-B's deep link — an authenticated render is the finding. Crown: session lifetime after logout.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
