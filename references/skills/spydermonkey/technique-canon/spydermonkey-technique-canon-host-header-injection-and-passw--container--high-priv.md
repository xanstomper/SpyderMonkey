# Host-header injection and password-reset poisoning — container / high-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-host-header-injection-and-passw.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**
- context: **container** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: namespace/capability surface — read-only inventory, no escape execution
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

Host header reaching generated links/emails/redirects. Decisive test: Host=your.domain on a state-changing POST — the generated URL in the response/email carries your host = the finding (pairs with the reset class).

## Probe adjustment (container × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
