## The technique

The brute class is a RATE problem before it is a CREDENTIAL problem: lockout windows, per-IP vs per-account throttling, and response-length uniformity decide feasibility. Decisive test: 5 wrong-password requests on one account, one on the next — a lockout on the first and none on the second means per-account throttling with per-IP rotation potential. Register the geometry (window, scope, response delta), never a harvested credential.
