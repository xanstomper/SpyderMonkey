# Price-override parameter injection — iot / high-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-price-override-parameter-inject.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-05** · **CWE-285** · **ATT&CK T1068**
- context: **iot** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **final**

## Context

- platform: radio/serial surface — BLE/NFC/UART classes, lab hardware only
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

Hidden/ignored client fields (`price`, `discount`, `unitPrice`) that the serializer re-binds into the order. Decisive test: add price=1 to the POST body; a changed order total without a server-side entitlement check is the class. NEVER submit the poisoned order — the preview response is the proof (no-gain).

## Probe adjustment (iot × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- the impact leg — shukaku prices what this rung reaches
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
