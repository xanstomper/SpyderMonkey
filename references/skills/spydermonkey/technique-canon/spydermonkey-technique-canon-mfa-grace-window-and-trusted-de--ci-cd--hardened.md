# MFA grace-window and trusted-device abuse — ci-cd / hardened

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-mfa-grace-window-and-trusted-de.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN-09** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **ci-cd** · auth **hardened** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: pipeline config/runner surface — secrets and lateral movement ride the runners
- auth state: a filter/WAF tier fronts the target: expect canonicalization and signature matching on the raw request — the probe vocabulary's encodings (double-encode, unicode, backslash, case-split) exist exactly for this tier; the differential must clear the filter WITHOUT tripping it, or the finding is a WAF flag, not a class confirmation. Low-and-slow: one variant per request, never a burst.

## The technique

"Remember this device" tied to a long-lived cookie outlives the OTP it certified. Decisive test: complete MFA once, capture the device cookie, and read its expiry + behavior after password change — MFA bypassed by a stolen cookie is the finding (characterize on your own principal).

## Probe adjustment (ci-cd × hardened)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
