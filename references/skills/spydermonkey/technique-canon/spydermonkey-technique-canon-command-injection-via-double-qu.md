# Command injection via double-quote/pipe variants

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon.md`
- bindings: **MASTG-RES** · **CWE-288** · **ATT&CK T1557**
- generated: 2026-11-06

## Route

- probes: `sqlmap`, `nosqlmap`, `tplmap`, `commix`, `crlfuzz`, `dotdotpwn`, `nmap-http-sqli`, `nmap-shellshock`
- chains: `fuzz`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

The documented class vocabulary (backtick, $( ), newline, %0a) applied ONE variant per request. Decisive test: an out-of-band marker (DNS to your registered domain) beats response-diff for blind injection — the marker arrival is the proof.
