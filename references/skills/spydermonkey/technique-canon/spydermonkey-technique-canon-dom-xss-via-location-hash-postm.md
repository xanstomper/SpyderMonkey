# DOM XSS via location.hash / postMessage

## Route

- probes: `dalfox`, `xsstrike`, `xsser`
- chains: `web`, `api`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

hash-borne sinks and postMessage handlers without origin checks. Decisive test: postMessage from YOUR page to the in-scope window — handler executes with your payload; the alert/echo in YOUR browser session is the proof (self-XSS framing stays hypothesis unless it crosses principals).

## Family use

- decisive-test shape lives in the source canon
- walls: validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
