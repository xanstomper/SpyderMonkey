# Source-map disclosure — ci-cd / unauth

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-source-map-disclosure.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-04** · **CWE-798** · **ATT&CK T1552**
- context: **ci-cd** · auth **unauth** · chain role **final**

## Context

- platform: pipeline config/runner surface — secrets and lateral movement ride the runners
- auth state: no credential material — the classic differential applies as-is; absent auth = the authn-bypass class

## The technique

.map files ship original source to anyone. Decisive test: GET /app.js.map → 200 JSON with sources — the finding; original code with secrets in comments = the crown.

## Probe adjustment (ci-cd × unauth)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- the impact leg — shukaku prices what this rung reaches
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
