# Trial reset and signup-limit bypass — edge-node / federated

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-trial-reset-and-signup-limit-by.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-05** · **CWE-285** · **ATT&CK T1068**
- context: **edge-node** · auth **federated** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-smtp-commands`, `nmap-smtp-enum-users`, `swaks`, `dig-mx`, `dig-txt`
- chains: `mail-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: cdn/origin edge — cache key and origin-pull trust are the class surface
- auth state: identity rides an external IdP (OAuth/OIDC/SAML/SSO): the differential is the TOKEN — audience, issuer, redirect_uri, scope downgrades, code/state reuse, and the exchange at the resource server; the local session may be fine while the trust boundary is not

## The technique

Trial entitlement tied to a client-controllable identity fragment (device id, email alias) is a logic seam. Decisive test: second trial via email+1 alias on your OWN address — entitlement granted = the finding (the abuse class, not the grant).

## Probe adjustment (edge-node × federated)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
