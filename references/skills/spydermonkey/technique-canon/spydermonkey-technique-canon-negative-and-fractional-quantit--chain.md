# Negative and fractional quantity — chain composition

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-negative-and-fractional-quantit.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

Quantity=-1 or 0.5 submitted to a cart/checkout inverts the math server-side. Decisive test: quantity=-1 on the cheapest line, read the recalculated total — negative TOTAL is the crown; rejected = bank the negative.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
