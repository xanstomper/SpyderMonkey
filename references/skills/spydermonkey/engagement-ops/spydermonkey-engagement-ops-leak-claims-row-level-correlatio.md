# Leak claims: row-level correlation or it isn't a finding

## The technique

Counting `"display_username"` fields does NOT prove a masking failure — a feed full of
visible users also contains that field. The decisive test: find rows where the masked
field (`username == "Hidden user"`) appears, then check the SAME row's `display_username`
for a real value. Report `masked occurrences → correlated rows → unique userIds`. Only the
correlated count is the leak; the rest is noise. Same discipline as the 3-gate: a diff
needs the baseline and the attack joined on the same object.
