# JWT & session-token crypto — chain composition

- source canon: `spydermonkey/crypto-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-crypto-canon-jwt-session-token-crypto.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `sslscan`, `sslyze`, `testssl`, `tlsx`, `ssh-audit`, `openssl`, `nmap-ssl-ciphers`, `nmap-script-ssl`, `ssh-keyscan`
- chains: `tls`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

| Probe | Test | Confirmed-when |
|---|---|---|
| alg=none | `jwt_tool -M none` on OWN issued token | none accepted |
| HS/RS confusion | `jwt_tool -X k` (own public key as HMAC) | signature verified with pubkey bytes |
| Weak HMAC | `hashcat -m 16500` on own token | secret cracked |
| kid/path trick | `jwt_tool` kid traversal (own token) | file-read marker |
| jku/x5u open | `jwt_tool -M pb` (own token) | attacker-supplied JWKS accepted (lab) |

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
