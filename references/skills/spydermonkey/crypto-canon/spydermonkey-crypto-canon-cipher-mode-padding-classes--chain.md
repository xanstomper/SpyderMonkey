# Cipher-mode & padding classes — chain composition

- source canon: `spydermonkey/crypto-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-crypto-canon-cipher-mode-padding-classes.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

| Probe | Test | Confirmed-when |
|---|---|---|
| ECB detect | duplicate ciphertext blocks on own oracle | ECB (blocks repeat) |
| CBC bitflip | flip own token byte, observe oracle | predictable plaintext change |
| IV reuse | capture two own sessions | identical IV across messages |
| Padding oracle (app) | `padbuster` on OWN app endpoint (lab) | oracle distinguishes padding |
| Nonce reuse | two own encryptions same nonce | keystream collision |

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
