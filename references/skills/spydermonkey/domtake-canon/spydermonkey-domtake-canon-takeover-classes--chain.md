# Takeover classes — chain composition

- source canon: `spydermonkey/domtake-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-domtake-canon-takeover-classes.md`
- chain role: **final — this CLOSES a chain: shukaku prices what it reaches; chain detect looks for the entries that feed it**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- final — this CLOSES a chain: shukaku prices what it reaches; chain detect looks for the entries that feed it

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

| Probe | Test | Confirmed-when |
|---|---|---|
| AWS S3 bucket | `s3scanner` check bucket name == cname (own) | bucket missing/claimable |
| Azure blob | `az storage container` existence probe (own) | container absent |
| GitHub pages | `curl` expected 404 signature (own) | pages site dormant |
| Heroku/Glitch | status code + body fingerprint (own) | app name free |
| Elastic IP | `whois`/`ipinfo` on cname (own) | eip released |
| Shopify/Wordpress | fingerprint strings (own) | storename claimable |
| Zendesk/Cargo | body markers (own) | subdomain free |
| Dead CDN | edge cert + 526/530 codes (own) | origin missing |

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
