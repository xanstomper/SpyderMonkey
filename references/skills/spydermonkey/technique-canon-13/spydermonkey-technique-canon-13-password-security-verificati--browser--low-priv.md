# Password-security verification — browser / low-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-13.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-13-password-security-verificati.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN-08** · **CWE-521** · **ATT&CK T1110**
- context: **browser** · auth **low-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: the CLIENT is the boundary — same-origin, extension, and postMessage trust are the probe shape
- auth state: hold ONE low-priv principal; swap object ids/roles upward only (idor/authz classes)

## The technique

Server-enforced length/complexity/newness tested by one policy-violating change. Decisive test: acceptance on your account = control absent.

## Probe adjustment (browser × low-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
