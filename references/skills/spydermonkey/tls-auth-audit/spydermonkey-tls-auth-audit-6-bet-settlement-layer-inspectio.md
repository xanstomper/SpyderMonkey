## The technique

Game bundles with an anti-exploit layer (`bet-guard`, `betGate`, `revealPacer`)
expose what the platform thinks its attack surface is. Look for client-side
pacing of money-relevant commits: `commitGuardMs` setTimeout deferrals,
`maxInflight`/`minIntervalMs` reveal pacing, client-held `txId`, `settle(payout)`
on bet objects, `commitWallet` called on client timers. Client-parametrized bet
APIs (`game.bet(amount, payout)` in public betting-script repos) put the
cashout target in client hands — that is the client-trust surface a
game-exploiter rides, and the shape to cite when reconstructing a disclosed
breach.
