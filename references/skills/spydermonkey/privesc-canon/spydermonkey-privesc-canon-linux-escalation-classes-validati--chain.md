# Linux — escalation classes (validation-only) — chain composition

- source canon: `spydermonkey/privesc-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-privesc-canon-linux-escalation-classes-validati.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

| Probe | Test | Confirmed-when |
|---|---|---|
| Sudo command abuse | `sudo -l` → run the listed tool with its `-l`/plan | listed tool reads root-only file (own) |
| SUID exploit | `checksec` + version match on own suid binary | vulnerable version confirmed (POC on own lab) |
| Capability abuse | run cap binary's documented read (own host) | root-only file readable |
| Cron script write | own user can edit the job (own host) | script runs as root |
| PATH hijack | own-writable dir earlier in PATH | root cron invokes bare name |
| Docker escape | `docker ps` → shared socket check (own ctr) | host mounts visible (own lab) |
| systemd unit | own-writable unit in /etc/systemd | unit enabled as root |
| GTFOBins match | `gtfo`-style query for owned binary (own host) | escape confirmed in lab |

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
