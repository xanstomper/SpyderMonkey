# Plugin fingerprint via assets — container / low-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-9.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-9-plugin-fingerprint-via-assets.md`
- bindings: **MASTG-RES** · **CWE-288** · **ATT&CK T1557**
- context: **container** · auth **low-priv** · chain role **entry**

## Context

- platform: namespace/capability surface — read-only inventory, no escape execution
- auth state: hold ONE low-priv principal; swap object ids/roles upward only (idor/authz classes)

## The technique

Plugin versions readable from asset paths/readme/changelog files. Decisive test: asset-path version map = the inventory crown.

## Probe adjustment (container × low-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- opens the kill chain (first blood) — pairs with the info/harvest/recon findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
