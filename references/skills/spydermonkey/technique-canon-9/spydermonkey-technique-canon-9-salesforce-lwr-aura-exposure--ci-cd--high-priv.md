# Salesforce LWR/Aura exposure — ci-cd / high-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-9.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-9-salesforce-lwr-aura-exposure.md`
- bindings: **MASTG-RES** · **CWE-288** · **ATT&CK T1557**
- context: **ci-cd** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **final**

## Context

- platform: pipeline config/runner surface — secrets and lateral movement ride the runners
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

Component/Aura endpoints revealing metadata/guest-accessible data (the SF LWR canon class). Decisive test: the endpoint's guest response = the finding.

## Probe adjustment (ci-cd × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- the impact leg — shukaku prices what this rung reaches
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
