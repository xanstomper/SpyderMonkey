# Heapdump class — kubernetes / low-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-9.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-9-heapdump-class.md`
- bindings: **MASTG-RES** · **CWE-288** · **ATT&CK T1557**
- context: **kubernetes** · auth **low-priv** · chain role **final**

## Context

- platform: RBAC/service-account surface — read-only enumeration, crown the exposure
- auth state: hold ONE low-priv principal; swap object ids/roles upward only (idor/authz classes)

## The technique

/actuator/heapdump downloadable — the memory-material exposure (contents characterized only, never mined live). Decisive test: the artifact's presence + size = the finding.

## Probe adjustment (kubernetes × low-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- the impact leg — shukaku prices what this rung reaches
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
