## The technique

Error handlers dumping stack + cwd, sourcemaps (already canon-I), .map on chunk files. Decisive test: forced error on a non-route — stack text with paths = the finding.

## Family use

- decisive-test shape lives in the source canon
- walls: validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
