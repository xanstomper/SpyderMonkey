# Django debug mode and ALLOWED_HOSTS gaps

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

DEBUG=true tracebacks (settings/secrets in the error page) and the 404 debug page. Decisive test: trigger a controlled 404/500 — the traceback panel is the finding.

## Family use

- decisive-test shape lives in the source canon
- walls: validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
