# RDP/NLA posture and NLA-absent classes — browser / federated

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-4.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-4-rdp-nla-posture-and-nla-absen.md`
- bindings: **PTES-RA** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1078**
- context: **browser** · auth **federated** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: the CLIENT is the boundary — same-origin, extension, and postMessage trust are the probe shape
- auth state: identity rides an external IdP (OAuth/OIDC/SAML/SSO): the differential is the TOKEN — audience, issuer, redirect_uri, scope downgrades, code/state reuse, and the exchange at the resource server; the local session may be fine while the trust boundary is not

## The technique

NLA required vs not (documented class), banner/tls posture. Decisive test: protocol handshake reaching the NLA stage — the stage reached IS the finding.

## Probe adjustment (browser × federated)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
