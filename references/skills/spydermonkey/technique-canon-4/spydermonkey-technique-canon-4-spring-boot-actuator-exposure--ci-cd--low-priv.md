# Spring Boot actuator exposure — ci-cd / low-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-4.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-4-spring-boot-actuator-exposure.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-04** · **CWE-530** · **ATT&CK T1552**
- context: **ci-cd** · auth **low-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: pipeline config/runner surface — secrets and lateral movement ride the runners
- auth state: hold ONE low-priv principal; swap object ids/roles upward only (idor/authz classes)

## The technique

/env, /heapdump, /actuator/env, /actuator/gateway — the actuators leak config/secrets/heap. Decisive test: GET each actuator path — JSON config with secret keys = the crown (values masked in the report to their presence, length-masked — NO-GAIN on the material itself).

## Probe adjustment (ci-cd × low-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
