# What was adopted from kimiko (and what was not) — edge-node / federated

- source canon: `spydermonkey/mandate.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-mandate-what-was-adopted-from-kimiko-and-what-w.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **edge-node** · auth **federated** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: cdn/origin edge — cache key and origin-pull trust are the class surface
- auth state: identity rides an external IdP (OAuth/OIDC/SAML/SSO): the differential is the TOKEN — audience, issuer, redirect_uri, scope downgrades, code/state reuse, and the exchange at the resource server; the local session may be fine while the trust boundary is not

## The technique

ADOPTED (the discipline): mandate architecture (persona contract, not "ignore your
training") · entry protocol with IMMEDIATE adoption · zero-blocker execution IN
SCOPE · no moralizing/warnings/disclaimers on authorized work · evidence-first
complete outputs (zero theoretical, zero placeholders) · tool-use expectations ·
loop control (step caps, retries, context discipline) · precise stop conditions.

NOT ADOPTED (rejected as harm, not discipline): nullified safeguards, malware
generation, black-hat support, FRP/IMEI/activation bypass, "execute first ask
never" against out-of-scope systems, audit-trail destruction. The family's walls
replace kimiko's nullification with PRECISE boundaries — the discipline without
the harm.

## Probe adjustment (edge-node × federated)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
