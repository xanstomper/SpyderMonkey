# S3 policy-gap classes — kubernetes / high-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-3.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-3-s3-policy-gap-classes.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-04** · **CWE-732** · **ATT&CK T1530**
- context: **kubernetes** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: RBAC/service-account surface — read-only enumeration, crown the exposure
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

Anonymous GET/LIST on bucket or prefix; ACL vs policy divergence; public-CDN origin overlap. Decisive test: anonymous LIST/GET one object (read-only) — the listing is the finding; never PUT/DELETE.

## Probe adjustment (kubernetes × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
