# Other carriers — web-app / machine

- source canon: `spydermonkey/stego-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-stego-canon-other-carriers.md`
- bindings: **PTES-OPSEC** · **CWE-200** · **ATT&CK T1070**
- context: **web-app** · auth **machine** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: strike through the browser/proxy path; the 3-gate differential runs on the reflected/accepted value
- auth state: the principal is a SERVICE identity (API key, SA token, CI secret, webhook signing key): the differential is the KEY's resource scope — key-level vs user-level objects, cross-tenant reach, unscoped keys, and which audit trail the key leaves; the human account model does not apply

## The technique

| Probe | Test | Confirmed-when |
|---|---|---|
| Polyglot | `file` + `binwalk` (own artifact) | two formats valid |
| Video frames | `ffmpeg` frame extraction → zsteg per frame (own) | frame-embedded data |
| PDF layers | `qpdf --show-objects` (own pdf) | hidden layers/attachments |
| Office content | `olevba`/`oleid` + `unzip -l` (own doc) | embedded objects |
| Trailing bytes | `xxd` tail + `strings` tail (own file) | appended payload |
| Cover vs stego | same-image diff (own pair) | byte drift located |

## Probe adjustment (web-app × machine)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
