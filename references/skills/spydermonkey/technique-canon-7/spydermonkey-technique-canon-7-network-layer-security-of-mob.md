# Network-layer security of mobile APIs

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-7.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL** · **CWE-200** · **ATT&CK T1005**

## Route

- probes: `nmap`, `masscan`, `naabu`, `zmap`, `nc`, `fping`, `nmap-allports`
- chains: `net`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

APIs accepting TLS-stripped traffic, ignoring cert errors, or trusting user CAs in release builds. Decisive test: your build's traffic through a local CA — accepted = the class (MASTG-NET).

## Family use

- decisive-test shape lives in the source canon
- walls: validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
