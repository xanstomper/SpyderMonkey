# Mobile deep-link and app-link hijack (depth) — firmware / unauth

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-7.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-7-mobile-deep-link-and-app-link.md`
- bindings: **MASTG-PLATFORM** · **CWE-927** · **ATT&CK T1546**
- context: **firmware** · auth **unauth** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: the check lives in the image — uart/flash/ota paths, no-gain read-only dumps
- auth state: no credential material — the classic differential applies as-is; absent auth = the authn-bypass class

## The technique

App-links without domain verification (assetlinks absent) = hijack-prep. Decisive test: the verification file's absence on the domain — 404/missing = the class.

## Probe adjustment (firmware × unauth)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
