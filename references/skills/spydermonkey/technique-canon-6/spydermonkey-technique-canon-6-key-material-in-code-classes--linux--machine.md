# Key-material-in-code classes — linux / machine

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-6.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-6-key-material-in-code-classes.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL** · **CWE-200** · **ATT&CK T1005**
- context: **linux** · auth **machine** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `sslscan`, `sslyze`, `testssl`, `tlsx`, `ssh-audit`, `openssl`, `nmap-ssl-ciphers`, `nmap-script-ssl`, `ssh-keyscan`
- chains: `tls`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: read-only inventory first (kaisha rungs), then the documented class match
- auth state: the principal is a SERVICE identity (API key, SA token, CI secret, webhook signing key): the differential is the KEY's resource scope — key-level vs user-level objects, cross-tenant reach, unscoped keys, and which audit trail the key leaves; the human account model does not apply

## The technique

Hardcoded keys/salts in bundles (the crash-verifier salt class, SPY-067 repo prefill) — the string context proves it is KEY MATERIAL (used in a live crypto op), not decoration. Decisive test: the key string + its use-site in the decompiled path — the pairing is the finding.

## Probe adjustment (linux × machine)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
