# Key-material-in-code classes — cloud / federated

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-6.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-6-key-material-in-code-classes.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL** · **CWE-200** · **ATT&CK T1005**
- context: **cloud** · auth **federated** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `sslscan`, `sslyze`, `testssl`, `tlsx`, `ssh-audit`, `openssl`, `nmap-ssl-ciphers`, `nmap-script-ssl`, `ssh-keyscan`
- chains: `tls`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: control-plane exposure — read-only, crown the class
- auth state: identity rides an external IdP (OAuth/OIDC/SAML/SSO): the differential is the TOKEN — audience, issuer, redirect_uri, scope downgrades, code/state reuse, and the exchange at the resource server; the local session may be fine while the trust boundary is not

## The technique

Hardcoded keys/salts in bundles (the crash-verifier salt class, SPY-067 repo prefill) — the string context proves it is KEY MATERIAL (used in a live crypto op), not decoration. Decisive test: the key string + its use-site in the decompiled path — the pairing is the finding.

## Probe adjustment (cloud × federated)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
