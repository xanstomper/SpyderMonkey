# Entropy/PRNG weakness classes — chain composition

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-6.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-6-entropy-prng-weakness-classes.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

Predictable tokens (Math.random, time-seeded PRNG, sequential ids) — the SPY-048/058 fingerprint-mint family is the live example. Decisive test: N sampled tokens from YOUR OWN sessions → entropy arithmetic (pairwise deltas, structure) — a sub-64-bit space or visible structure = the finding; an evenly-distributed space is the banked negative (the ggpoker alias test).

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
