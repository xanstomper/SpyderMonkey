# Entropy/PRNG weakness classes — worker / service

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-6.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-6-entropy-prng-weakness-classes.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-01** · **CWE-681** · **ATT&CK T1565**
- context: **worker** · auth **service** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: edge/background runtime — the check runs where the caller has no visible context
- auth state: a daemon/listener identity — the probe targets what the service can see and invoke, not what a human session can

## The technique

Predictable tokens (Math.random, time-seeded PRNG, sequential ids) — the SPY-048/058 fingerprint-mint family is the live example. Decisive test: N sampled tokens from YOUR OWN sessions → entropy arithmetic (pairwise deltas, structure) — a sub-64-bit space or visible structure = the finding; an evenly-distributed space is the banked negative (the ggpoker alias test).

## Probe adjustment (worker × service)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
