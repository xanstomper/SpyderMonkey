# OAuth per-grant-type classes

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-6.md`

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

Implicit (canon-I), password-grant legacy, device-flow cross-device pollution, refresh-token rotation gaps — one class per grant type, decisive test = the token-exchange differential on YOUR registered client.

## Family use

- decisive-test shape lives in the source canon
- walls: validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
