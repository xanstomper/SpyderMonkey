# Provably-fair chain verification (decisive-negative)

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-6.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-01** · **CWE-681** · **ATT&CK T1565**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

hash(N-1)=SHA256(hash(N)) across 99 live rounds = committed chain; 0/95 derivations matching your own recomputation = server-secret-backed multiplier (SPY-059). The chain arithmetic IS the finding — no prediction claimed beyond the math.
