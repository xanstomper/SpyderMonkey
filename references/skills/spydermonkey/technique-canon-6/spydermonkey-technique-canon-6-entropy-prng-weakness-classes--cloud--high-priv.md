# Entropy/PRNG weakness classes — cloud / high-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-6.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-6-entropy-prng-weakness-classes.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-01** · **CWE-681** · **ATT&CK T1565**
- context: **cloud** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: control-plane exposure — read-only, crown the class
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

Predictable tokens (Math.random, time-seeded PRNG, sequential ids) — the SPY-048/058 fingerprint-mint family is the live example. Decisive test: N sampled tokens from YOUR OWN sessions → entropy arithmetic (pairwise deltas, structure) — a sub-64-bit space or visible structure = the finding; an evenly-distributed space is the banked negative (the ggpoker alias test).

## Probe adjustment (cloud × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
