# MASTG Data in Clipboard and Keyboard Cache (MASTG-STORAGE-04) — android / unauth

- source canon: `spydermonkey/mobile-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-mobile-canon-mastg-data-in-clipboard-and-keyboa.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-04** · **CWE-798** · **ATT&CK T1552**
- context: **android** · auth **unauth** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: the check often lives client-side — frida/objection at the runtime, MASTG methodology
- auth state: no credential material — the classic differential applies as-is; absent auth = the authn-bypass class

## The technique

- class: clipboard sync + keyboard autocorrect retaining secrets
- probe: paste a marker, inspect the keyboard cache db
- wall: lab only

## Probe adjustment (android × unauth)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
