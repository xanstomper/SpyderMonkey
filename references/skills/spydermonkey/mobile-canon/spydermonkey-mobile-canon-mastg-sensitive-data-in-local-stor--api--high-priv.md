# MASTG Sensitive Data in Local Storage (MASTG-STORAGE-02) — api / high-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/mobile-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-mobile-canon-mastg-sensitive-data-in-local-stor.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-INPV-05** · **CWE-89** · **ATT&CK T1190**
- context: **api** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: strike the JSON body + query string; content-type and parameter placement change the probe shape
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

- class: shared prefs / sqlite / files holding credentials unencrypted
- probe: read the app sandbox on the lab device; diff the storage before/after a login
- wall: lab device, lab app; the finding is the storage class, not the data

## Probe adjustment (api × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
