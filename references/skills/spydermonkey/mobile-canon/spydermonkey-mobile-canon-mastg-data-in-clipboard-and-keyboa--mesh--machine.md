# MASTG Data in Clipboard and Keyboard Cache (MASTG-STORAGE-04) — mesh / machine

- source canon: `spydermonkey/mobile-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-mobile-canon-mastg-data-in-clipboard-and-keyboa.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-04** · **CWE-798** · **ATT&CK T1552**
- context: **mesh** · auth **machine** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: service-mesh sidecar surface — own mesh, read-only mTLS posture
- auth state: the principal is a SERVICE identity (API key, SA token, CI secret, webhook signing key): the differential is the KEY's resource scope — key-level vs user-level objects, cross-tenant reach, unscoped keys, and which audit trail the key leaves; the human account model does not apply

## The technique

- class: clipboard sync + keyboard autocorrect retaining secrets
- probe: paste a marker, inspect the keyboard cache db
- wall: lab only

## Probe adjustment (mesh × machine)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
