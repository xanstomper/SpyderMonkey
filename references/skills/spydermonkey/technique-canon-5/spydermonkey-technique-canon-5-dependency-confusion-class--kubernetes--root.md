# Dependency-confusion class — kubernetes / root

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-5.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-5-dependency-confusion-class.md`
- bindings: **MASTG-RES** · **CWE-288** · **ATT&CK T1557**
- context: **kubernetes** · auth **root** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: RBAC/service-account surface — read-only enumeration, crown the exposure
- auth state: the highest local principal — confirm the class from the top down (downgrade/view-as tests, no-gain reads are the crown)

## The technique

Internal package names resolvable from public registries — the CLASS is the name-collision exposure. Decisive test: registry metadata check for an internal-named package (metadata only, never publish) — resolvable = the finding.

## Probe adjustment (kubernetes × root)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
