# BLE enumeration (lab)

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

GATT service/characteristic inventory on lab devices — write-characteristic tests NEVER fired on third-party devices. Decisive test: your lab device's characteristic map — unauth-read characteristics = the class.

## Family use

- decisive-test shape lives in the source canon
- walls: validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
