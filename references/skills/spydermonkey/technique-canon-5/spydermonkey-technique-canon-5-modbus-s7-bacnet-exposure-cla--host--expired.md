# Modbus/S7/BACnet exposure classes — host / expired

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-5.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-5-modbus-s7-bacnet-exposure-cla.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **host** · auth **expired** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: era-stack banner mapping (kaisha cve) before any rung
- auth state: the credential/session has lapsed — the class probes reuse, reactivation, and the no-revoke gap

## The technique

Protocol banners reachable unauth (502/102/47808) — the BANNER is the inventory finding; control writes are the absolute wall (never sent). Decisive test: read-only identity/banners on in-scope industrial tiers.

## Probe adjustment (host × expired)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
