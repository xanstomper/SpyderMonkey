# Paste/site and dump-index sweeps — cloud / high-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-5.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-5-paste-site-and-dump-index-swe.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**
- context: **cloud** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **final**

## Context

- platform: control-plane exposure — read-only, crown the class
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

Paste-site keyword sweeps and dump-index catalogs tied to the estate (LeakRadar-class sources) — the row-level rule applies. Decisive test: source URL + correlated row count per source, distinct leading words per title (dedupe discipline).

## Probe adjustment (cloud × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- the impact leg — shukaku prices what this rung reaches
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
