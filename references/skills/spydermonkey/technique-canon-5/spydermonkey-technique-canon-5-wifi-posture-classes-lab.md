# WiFi posture classes (lab)

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-5.md`

## Route

- probes: `nmap`, `masscan`, `naabu`, `zmap`, `nc`, `fping`, `nmap-allports`
- chains: `net`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

Open/guest-network isolation classes, WPA2-Enterprise cert-validation behavior — probed ONLY on lab APs you own. Decisive test: client isolation between your own two lab stations — the reachability delta is the class.

## Family use

- decisive-test shape lives in the source canon
- walls: validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
