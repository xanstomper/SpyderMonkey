# ASN/BGP/WHOIS netblock intel

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-5.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

Estate netblocks via ASN, rDNS sweep across the range, WHOIS org pivots — the netblock map extends the scope estate (scope add is the operator's call). Decisive test: rDNS inventory rows for in-scope ranges.
