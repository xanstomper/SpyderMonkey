# XSS per-execution-context — chain composition

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-2.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-2-xss-per-execution-context.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

HTML-body, attribute, JS-string, URL-attribute (`href`/`src` javascript:), and CSS contexts each need THEIR encoding-vocabulary variant. Decisive test: the reflected marker in the correct context form — context-specific execution in YOUR session is the proof; stored/cross-principal framing stays hypothesis without a second principal.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
