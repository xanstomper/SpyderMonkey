# PHP unserialize pop-chain DNS proof

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-2.md`

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

`unserialize` entry points proven with a DNS-only pop chain (file_put → phar stream wrappers documented as the escalation class). Decisive test: OOB DNS from the phar/jdbc-style wrapper.

## Family use

- decisive-test shape lives in the source canon
- walls: validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
