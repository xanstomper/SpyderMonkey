# Redirect-based SSRF — worker / low-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-2.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-2-redirect-based-ssrf.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-INPV-10** · **CWE-918** · **ATT&CK T1190**
- context: **worker** · auth **low-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: edge/background runtime — the check runs where the caller has no visible context
- auth state: hold ONE low-priv principal; swap object ids/roles upward only (idor/authz classes)

## The technique

An open redirect chains an SSRF-protected fetch past the allowlist. Decisive test: SSRF-prone param → in-scope redirector → internal marker URL — the fetch following the redirect IS the proof (one hop, read-only).

## Probe adjustment (worker × low-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
