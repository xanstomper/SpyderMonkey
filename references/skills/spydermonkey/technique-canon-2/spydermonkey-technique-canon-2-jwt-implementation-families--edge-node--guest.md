# JWT implementation families — edge-node / guest

- source canon: `spydermonkey/technique-canon-2.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-technique-canon-2-jwt-implementation-families.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-SESS** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1528**
- context: **edge-node** · auth **guest** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `sqlmap`, `nosqlmap`, `tplmap`, `commix`, `crlfuzz`, `dotdotpwn`, `nmap-http-sqli`, `nmap-shellshock`
- chains: `fuzz`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: cdn/origin edge — cache key and origin-pull trust are the class surface
- auth state: a filter/WAF tier fronts the target: expect canonicalization and signature matching on the raw request — the probe vocabulary's encodings (double-encode, unicode, backslash, case-split) exist exactly for this tier; the differential must clear the filter WITHOUT tripping it, or the finding is a WAF flag, not a class confirmation. Low-and-slow: one variant per request, never a burst.

## The technique

`none`-alg acceptance, kid-injection, jku/x5u self-keying, weak HMAC secrets (tested offline against a known dictionary ONLY on your own tokens). Decisive test per family: acceptance delta of the forged-but-harmless token.

## Probe adjustment (edge-node × guest)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
