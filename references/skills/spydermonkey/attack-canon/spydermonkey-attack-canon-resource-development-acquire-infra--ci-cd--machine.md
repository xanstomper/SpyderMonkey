# Resource Development Acquire Infrastructure (T1583) — ci-cd / machine

- source canon: `spydermonkey/attack-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-attack-canon-resource-development-acquire-infra.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**
- context: **ci-cd** · auth **machine** · chain role **final**

## Context

- platform: pipeline config/runner surface — secrets and lateral movement ride the runners
- auth state: the principal is a SERVICE identity (API key, SA token, CI secret, webhook signing key): the differential is the KEY's resource scope — key-level vs user-level objects, cross-tenant reach, unscoped keys, and which audit trail the key leaves; the human account model does not apply

## The technique

- class: domains, VPSes, botnets the adversary stands up for the engagement
- probe: not exercised live — the estate inventories what ALREADY exists in scope
- wall: NO-GAIN; the family maps, it does not stand up live infra

## Probe adjustment (ci-cd × machine)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- the impact leg — shukaku prices what this rung reaches
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
