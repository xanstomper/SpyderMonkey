# Credential Access Brute Force (T1110) — web-app / hardened

- source canon: `spydermonkey/attack-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-attack-canon-credential-access-brute-force-t111.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **web-app** · auth **hardened** · chain role **final**

## Context

- platform: strike through the browser/proxy path; the 3-gate differential runs on the reflected/accepted value
- auth state: a filter/WAF tier fronts the target: expect canonicalization and signature matching on the raw request — the probe vocabulary's encodings (double-encode, unicode, backslash, case-split) exist exactly for this tier; the differential must clear the filter WITHOUT tripping it, or the finding is a WAF flag, not a class confirmation. Low-and-slow: one variant per request, never a burst.

## The technique

- class: password spraying, credential stuffing
- probe: dojo replica only — the AUTHN battery proves the class shape
- wall: live spraying is a refusal (rc=1) every time

## Probe adjustment (web-app × hardened)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- the impact leg — shukaku prices what this rung reaches
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
