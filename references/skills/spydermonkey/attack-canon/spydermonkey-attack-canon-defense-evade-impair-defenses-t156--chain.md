# Defense Evade Impair Defenses (T1562) — chain composition

- source canon: `spydermonkey/attack-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-attack-canon-defense-evade-impair-defenses-t156.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- class: disabling logging/AV/EDR
- probe: NEVER — the opposite: protect scan proves the family leaves logs intact
- wall: REFUSED; impairing defenses violates every family law

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
