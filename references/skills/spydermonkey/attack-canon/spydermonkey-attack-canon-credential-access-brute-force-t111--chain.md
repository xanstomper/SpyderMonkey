# Credential Access Brute Force (T1110) — chain composition

- source canon: `spydermonkey/attack-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-attack-canon-credential-access-brute-force-t111.md`
- chain role: **final — this CLOSES a chain: shukaku prices what it reaches; chain detect looks for the entries that feed it**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- class: password spraying, credential stuffing
- probe: dojo replica only — the AUTHN battery proves the class shape
- wall: live spraying is a refusal (rc=1) every time

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
