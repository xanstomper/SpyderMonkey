# Resource Development Acquire Infrastructure (T1583) — cloud / federated

- source canon: `spydermonkey/attack-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-attack-canon-resource-development-acquire-infra.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**
- context: **cloud** · auth **federated** · chain role **final**

## Context

- platform: control-plane exposure — read-only, crown the class
- auth state: identity rides an external IdP (OAuth/OIDC/SAML/SSO): the differential is the TOKEN — audience, issuer, redirect_uri, scope downgrades, code/state reuse, and the exchange at the resource server; the local session may be fine while the trust boundary is not

## The technique

- class: domains, VPSes, botnets the adversary stands up for the engagement
- probe: not exercised live — the estate inventories what ALREADY exists in scope
- wall: NO-GAIN; the family maps, it does not stand up live infra

## Probe adjustment (cloud × federated)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- the impact leg — shukaku prices what this rung reaches
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
