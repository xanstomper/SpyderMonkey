# Recon Active Scanning (T1595) — wasm / service

- source canon: `spydermonkey/attack-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-attack-canon-recon-active-scanning-t1595.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **wasm** · auth **service** · chain role **entry**

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: sandbox internals — memory/import surface, own compiled artifact only
- auth state: a daemon/listener identity — the probe targets what the service can see and invoke, not what a human session can

## The technique

- class: adversarial scanning of the victim surface — port sweeps, vuln scans, wordlist strikes
- probe: rate-limited sweep of the declared scope only; masscan-class first, then app layer
- wall: in-scope only — the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)

## Probe adjustment (wasm × service)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- opens the kill chain (first blood) — pairs with the info/harvest/recon findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
