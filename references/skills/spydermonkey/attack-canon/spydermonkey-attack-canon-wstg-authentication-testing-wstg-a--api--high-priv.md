# WSTG Authentication Testing (WSTG-AUTHN) — api / high-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/attack-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-attack-canon-wstg-authentication-testing-wstg-a.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **api** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: strike the JSON body + query string; content-type and parameter placement change the probe shape
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

- class: credentials, reset flows, remember-me, logout, browser cache
- probe: the AUTHN battery (empty/forged factors) + JWT alg=none
- wall: no real credential abuse; differentials against the replica shape

## Probe adjustment (api × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
