# Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567) — mesh / guest

- source canon: `spydermonkey/attack-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-attack-canon-exfiltration-over-web-service-t156.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-02** · **CWE-840** · **ATT&CK T1565**
- context: **mesh** · auth **guest** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `s3scanner`, `cloudbrute`, `cloudlist`, `kube-hunter`, `shodan`
- chains: `cloud-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: service-mesh sidecar surface — own mesh, read-only mTLS posture
- auth state: a filter/WAF tier fronts the target: expect canonicalization and signature matching on the raw request — the probe vocabulary's encodings (double-encode, unicode, backslash, case-split) exist exactly for this tier; the differential must clear the filter WITHOUT tripping it, or the finding is a WAF flag, not a class confirmation. Low-and-slow: one variant per request, never a burst.

## The technique

- class: data out through trusted clouds
- probe: never exercised; the IMPACT LEG is priced by shukaku instead
- wall: NO-GAIN — exfiltration is priced hypothetically, never performed

## Probe adjustment (mesh × guest)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
