# Resource Development Develop Capabilities (T1587) — api / service

- source canon: `spydermonkey/attack-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-attack-canon-resource-development-develop-capab.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-INFO** · **CWE-200** · **ATT&CK T1592**
- context: **api** · auth **service** · chain role **final**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: strike the JSON body + query string; content-type and parameter placement change the probe shape
- auth state: a daemon/listener identity — the probe targets what the service can see and invoke, not what a human session can

## The technique

- class: malware/exploit/cert development
- probe: the family's "capabilities" are validators and provers, never payloads
- wall: NO-GAIN — every shipped script is read-only toward the operator's targets

## Probe adjustment (api × service)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- the impact leg — shukaku prices what this rung reaches
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
