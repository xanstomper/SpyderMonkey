# WSTG Authorization Testing (WSTG-AUTHZ) — mobile-api / guest

- source canon: `spydermonkey/attack-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-attack-canon-wstg-authorization-testing-wstg-au.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHZ-04** · **CWE-639** · **ATT&CK T1068**
- context: **mobile-api** · auth **guest** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: the mobile client IS another api principal — same routes, different trust assumptions
- auth state: a filter/WAF tier fronts the target: expect canonicalization and signature matching on the raw request — the probe vocabulary's encodings (double-encode, unicode, backslash, case-split) exist exactly for this tier; the differential must clear the filter WITHOUT tripping it, or the finding is a WAF flag, not a class confirmation. Low-and-slow: one variant per request, never a burst.

## The technique

- class: idor, privilege escalation, forced browsing
- probe: the IDOR battery (±1/0/-1/999999) + AUTHZ flips, upward only
- wall: never downward — never touch other tenants' data beyond the probe

## Probe adjustment (mobile-api × guest)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
