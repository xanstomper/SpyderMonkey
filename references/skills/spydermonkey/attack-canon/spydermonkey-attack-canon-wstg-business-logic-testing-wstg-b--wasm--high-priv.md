# WSTG Business Logic Testing (WSTG-BUSL) — wasm / high-priv

- source canon: `spydermonkey/attack-canon.md`
- base technique: `spydermonkey-attack-canon-wstg-business-logic-testing-wstg-b.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-01** · **CWE-681** · **ATT&CK T1565**
- context: **wasm** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: sandbox internals — memory/import surface, own compiled artifact only
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

- class: price tampering, quantity abuse, rounding, race conditions
- probe: the BIZLOGIC battery (negative/zero/overflow quantity) — replica proof
- wall: live business-logic abuse is refused; the differential is the deliverable

## Probe adjustment (wasm × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
