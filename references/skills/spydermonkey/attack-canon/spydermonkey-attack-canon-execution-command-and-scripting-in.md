# Execution Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)

- source canon: `spydermonkey/attack-canon.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-INPV** · **CWE-74** · **ATT&CK T1190**
- generated: 2026-11-04

## Route

- probes: `sqlmap`, `nosqlmap`, `tplmap`, `commix`, `crlfuzz`, `dotdotpwn`, `nmap-http-sqli`, `nmap-shellshock`
- chains: `fuzz`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- class: shell/powershell/python interpreters as the execution primitive
- probe: the cmd-injection battery (`;id`, `$(id)`, backticks) — echo differential only
- wall: proof = a benign marker echoed; never a destructive command

## Family use

- decisive-test shape lives in the source canon
- walls: validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
