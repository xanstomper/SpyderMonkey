# 2. Capture the live game feed unauth — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/provably-fair-verification.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-provably-fair-verification-2-capture-the-live-.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- Find the game's websocket namespace (socket.io `/crash`, `/dice`, ... — see
  references/websocket-auth-testing.md for namespace discovery and rejection semantics).
- Listen ≥ full round cycles (~20-40s each; a 10s window catches only ticks).
- Record EVERY event + payload. socket.io events may split across engine.io frames —
  buffer raw bytes for the window and parse with a frame state machine; naive
  per-recv JSON parses fail at ~4KB TCP boundaries and produce phantom truncations.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
