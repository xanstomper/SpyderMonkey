# 2. Capture the live game feed unauth

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/provably-fair-verification.md`

## The technique

- Find the game's websocket namespace (socket.io `/crash`, `/dice`, ... — see
  references/websocket-auth-testing.md for namespace discovery and rejection semantics).
- Listen ≥ full round cycles (~20-40s each; a 10s window catches only ticks).
- Record EVERY event + payload. socket.io events may split across engine.io frames —
  buffer raw bytes for the window and parse with a frame state machine; naive
  per-recv JSON parses fail at ~4KB TCP boundaries and produce phantom truncations.
