# 5. Forced-outcome capability — api / federated

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/provably-fair-verification.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-provably-fair-verification-5-forced-outcome-ca.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-INFO** · **CWE-200** · **ATT&CK T1592**
- context: **api** · auth **federated** · chain role **final**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: strike the JSON body + query string; content-type and parameter placement change the probe shape
- auth state: identity rides an external IdP (OAuth/OIDC/SAML/SSO): the differential is the TOKEN — audience, issuer, redirect_uri, scope downgrades, code/state reuse, and the exchange at the resource server; the local session may be fine while the trust boundary is not

## The technique

Watch result events for `forced` / manual-control flags. The flag existing in the
PUBLIC event schema = a staff-side outcome-control surface is a system feature (the
chain would not cover a forced round — that is the escape hatch). All-false captures
= capability present, use unproven; a `forced:true` round in anyone's evidence = the
control in use. Either way this is the caveat that must ride the rebuttal package.

## Probe adjustment (api × federated)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- the impact leg — shukaku prices what this rung reaches
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
