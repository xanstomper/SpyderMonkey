# CONFIRMED HOLYSHIT #1 — unauth realtime GPS surveillance (score 90) — api / unauth

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-iceposeidon-safezone.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-iceposeidon-safezone-confirmed-holyshit-1.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-01** · **CWE-1336** · **ATT&CK T1565**
- context: **api** · auth **unauth** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: strike the JSON body + query string; content-type and parameter placement change the probe shape
- auth state: no credential material — the classic differential applies as-is; absent auth = the authn-bypass class

## The technique

Streaming kind-1 fixes at ~300ms + `tracked_devices` JSON = meter-precision live tracking of real people with zero credentials. Verified: Nate tracked-device at **3.8m accuracy + live heading (~146°, walking S)** updating ~1/s; contestant slots 21/27/67 tracked continuously; tracker also correlates staff↔contestant proximity (slot 27 was ~20m from Nate's device). Invisible-status contestants still appear in binary fixes (invisibility hides on map render, not in stream).

## Probe adjustment (api × unauth)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
