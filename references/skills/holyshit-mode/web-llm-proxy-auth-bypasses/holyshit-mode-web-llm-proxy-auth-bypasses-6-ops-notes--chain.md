# 6. Ops notes — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/web-llm-proxy-auth-bypasses.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-web-llm-proxy-auth-bypasses-6-ops-notes.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- Cloudflare 1010 blocks python-urllib UA; use curl with browser UA + Origin/apikey headers.
- Mailinator API (`/api/v2/domains/public/inboxes/<user>`) works for inbox checks, but when
  target SMTP is broken nothing arrives — don't retry the email path, pivot.
- Blocked by broken mailer: email change verify, recovery, magic link — all silent.
- Ledger: record score ≥80 findings via holyleadger `confirmed`; statuses are only
  confirmed/inconclusive/hypothesis/negative (no `disclosure` status).

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
