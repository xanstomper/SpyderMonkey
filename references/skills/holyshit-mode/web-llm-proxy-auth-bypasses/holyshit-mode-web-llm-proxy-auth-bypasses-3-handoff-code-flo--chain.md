# 3. Handoff-code flow = credential minting without gates — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/web-llm-proxy-auth-bypasses.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-web-llm-proxy-auth-bypasses-3-handoff-code-flo.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- `POST /api/auth/platform-handoff/start` with body `{refresh_token, next, target}` +
  Bearer session accepts ANY target (`admin`, `platform`, `chat`, `sillytavern`, ...).
- Returns 32-hex one-time codes, 60s TTL, redirect to subdomain you may not have recon'd
  (chat./platform./sillytavern. subdomains appeared here — always enumerate from handoff targets).
- Exchange: `POST /api/auth/platform-handoff/exchange {code}` — works cross-host, is
  unthrottled, and DOES NOT check email verification. Replay works within TTL, single-use after.
- Codes look UUIDv4 (128-bit) — not brute-forceable; value is the bypass + new hosts.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
