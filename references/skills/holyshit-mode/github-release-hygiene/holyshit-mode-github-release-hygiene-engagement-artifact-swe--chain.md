# Engagement-Artifact Sweep (the `git add -A` publication trap) — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/github-release-hygiene.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-github-release-hygiene-engagement-artifact-swe.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

`git add -A` in a repo with untracked engagement dirs (logs/, reports/, captures/) commits
and PUBLISHES them to the public mirror — an engagement report and a 10k-line watch log
landed in the HolyShit repo this way and had to be unpublished.

**Rule:** before any `git add -A`, run `git status --porcelain` and stage explicit paths
(scripts/, references/). `.gitignore` must carry `logs/`, `reports/`, `captures/`,
`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc` from day one.

**Unpublish ≠ purge:** `git rm --cached` + commit removes files from HEAD but they remain
in history — anyone can checkout the old commit. Full removal needs a force-push history
rewrite (operator's call; state it plainly when it happens).

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
