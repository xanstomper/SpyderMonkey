# Staging / parallel-environment discovery

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/llm-gateway-internal-control-plane.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- generated: 2026-11-04

## Route

- probes: `s3scanner`, `cloudbrute`, `cloudlist`, `kube-hunter`, `shodan`
- chains: `cloud-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- Brute `*.domain` subdomains; a **staging host** is often AWS-direct (no Cloudflare; IP ranges
  like `16.x/54.x/3.x` = AWS) with its OWN `llms.txt`, `/.well-known/api-catalog`,
  keyless `openapi.json` + `/api/models` catalog, and a `api.staging.<domain>` gateway.
- Staging catalogs can expose MORE hidden internal infra than prod (Modal `*.modal.direct` GPU
  URLs, `stealth/<model>` hidden-tier names, `-private`/`-latest` slugs).
- Modal endpoints may be scale-to-zero (`503 no upstreams available`) — a waking function with
  open auth = free GPU, but usually Modal web-auth applies.
