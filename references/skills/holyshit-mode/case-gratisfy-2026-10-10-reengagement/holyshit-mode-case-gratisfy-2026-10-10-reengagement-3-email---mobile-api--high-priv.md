# 3. Email confirmation broken (score 55) — mobile-api / high-priv

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-gratisfy-2026-10-10-reengagement.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-gratisfy-2026-10-10-reengagement-3-email-.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **mobile-api** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-smtp-commands`, `nmap-smtp-enum-users`, `swaks`, `dig-mx`, `dig-txt`
- chains: `mail-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: the mobile client IS another api principal — same routes, different trust assumptions
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

POST /auth/v1/signup returns HTTP 500 but user row IS created with role:authenticated.

## Probe adjustment (mobile-api × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
