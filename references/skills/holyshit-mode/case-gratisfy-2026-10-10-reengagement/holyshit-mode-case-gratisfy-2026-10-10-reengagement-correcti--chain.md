# Corrections to older case files — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-gratisfy-2026-10-10-reengagement.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-gratisfy-2026-10-10-reengagement-correcti.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-smtp-commands`, `nmap-smtp-enum-users`, `swaks`, `dig-mx`, `dig-txt`
- chains: `mail-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- case-gratisfy-xyz.md "SMS OTP dead server-side" — still true for OTP verify, but phone SIGNUP autoconfirm supersedes as the free-session primitive.
- case-gratisfy-reengagement2.md "handoff code one-time" — refine: one-time only after 60s TTL; within TTL replay succeeds.
- This file's session-3 "email delivery fully broken" — DEAD. See session 4 below.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
