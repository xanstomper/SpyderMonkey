# Gotcha: cargo env in heredoc scripts — web-app / high-priv

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-gratisfy-2026-10-10-reengagement.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-gratisfy-2026-10-10-reengagement-gotcha-c.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-04** · **CWE-530** · **ATT&CK T1552**
- context: **web-app** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: strike through the browser/proxy path; the 3-gate differential runs on the reflected/accepted value
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

source ~/.cargo/env in ~/.bashrc causes errors when writing Python via heredoc in terminal.
Use python3 directly or add 2>/dev/null after sourcing.

## Probe adjustment (web-app × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
