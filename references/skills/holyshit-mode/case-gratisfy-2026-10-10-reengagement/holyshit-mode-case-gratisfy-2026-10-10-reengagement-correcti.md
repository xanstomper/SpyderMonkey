## Route

- probes: `nmap-smtp-commands`, `nmap-smtp-enum-users`, `swaks`, `dig-mx`, `dig-txt`
- chains: `mail-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- case-gratisfy-xyz.md "SMS OTP dead server-side" — still true for OTP verify, but phone SIGNUP autoconfirm supersedes as the free-session primitive.
- case-gratisfy-reengagement2.md "handoff code one-time" — refine: one-time only after 60s TTL; within TTL replay succeeds.
- This file's session-3 "email delivery fully broken" — DEAD. See session 4 below.
