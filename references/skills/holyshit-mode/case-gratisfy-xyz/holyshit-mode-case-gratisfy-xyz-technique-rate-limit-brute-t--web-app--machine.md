# Technique: rate-limit brute test (reusable) — web-app / machine

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-gratisfy-xyz.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-gratisfy-xyz-technique-rate-limit-brute-t.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-SESS** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1528**
- context: **web-app** · auth **machine** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: strike through the browser/proxy path; the 3-gate differential runs on the reflected/accepted value
- auth state: the principal is a SERVICE identity (API key, SA token, CI secret, webhook signing key): the differential is the KEY's resource scope — key-level vs user-level objects, cross-tenant reach, unscoped keys, and which audit trail the key leaves; the human account model does not apply

## The technique

For any code-exchange/token endpoint: 15–20 rapid POSTs with garbage codes in a shell loop, collect `-w "%{http_code}"`. All 401/400 with zero 429 = brute surface open. Confirm uniform error strings (no oracle), note entropy/TTL as the unknown.

## Probe adjustment (web-app × machine)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
