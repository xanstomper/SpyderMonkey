# Technique: auth-mode header split discovery

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-gratisfy-xyz.md`

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

Multi-tenant SPA bundles carry an auth-mode selector header (`X-Chat-Auth-Mode: account|platform_key`). The error chain enumerates itself: endpoint bare → 400 naming the header → each value names the next required credential. Each branch validates DIFFERENT credentials against DIFFERENT backends — treat each branch as its own auth surface.
