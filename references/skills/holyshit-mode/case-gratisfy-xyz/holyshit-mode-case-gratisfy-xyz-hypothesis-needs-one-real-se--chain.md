# Hypothesis (needs one real session/key to prove) — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-gratisfy-xyz.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-gratisfy-xyz-hypothesis-needs-one-real-se.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- **`chat_auth_mode_split` (score 65)**: chat backend accepts `X-Chat-Auth-Mode: platform_key` and validates a CLIENT-supplied `X-Gratisfy-API-Key` header. Uniform `401 invalid_api_key` across key shapes = no format oracle. If validation bypasses (truncation, format quirk, header confusion with `Authorization`), full chat-API access. conversations/media/realtime/attachments all gated the same way.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
