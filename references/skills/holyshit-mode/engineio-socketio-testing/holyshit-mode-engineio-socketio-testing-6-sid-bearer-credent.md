# 6. sid = bearer credential (attach test)

## The technique

- A second websocket using an EXISTING sid attaches to that session (101 accepted, ping answered). The origin allowlist is client-asserted — it stops cross-site browser JS, NOT a scripted attacker who fakes the header.
- Mechanism test: obtain a live sid (page-context hook capturing socket OPEN frames, or your own session), attach a second socket from python, send `2` (v2 ping), expect pong. Do NOT emit application frames on an attached session.
- Impact gate: only AUTHED sockets carry personal events — the sid-attach is the mechanism finding; severity lives in what rides authed sessions.
