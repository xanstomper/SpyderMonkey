# 8. Cross-brand (sibling-domain) drift

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/engineio-socketio-testing.md`

## Route

- probes: `nmap-slowloris-check`, `curl`
- chains: `web`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- Sister brands on the same stack (same error envelopes, CSP, cookies, CDN IPs): diff RPC method tables, namespace sets, endpoint literals, and gate behavior across brands. Older deployments expose different (usually smaller) surfaces and reveal which gates are new.
- Read the namespace init packet's `serverHost` — pods named `<brand>-rcc-slave-*` identify the INFRA OWNER and prove the fleet relationship at the socket level (a sister brand serving your sockets = same operator; their CSP cross-brand collectors corroborate).
- When the origin brand is geo-blocked from your vantage, its accessible sister brand usually runs the SAME shared data plane — the sister is the working vantage; probing the geo-walled brand's socket/API directly is wasted calls.
