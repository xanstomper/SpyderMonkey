# 9. Websocket origin allowlist — websocket / high-priv

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/engineio-socketio-testing.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-engineio-socketio-testing-9-websocket-origin-a.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CLNT-05** · **CWE-345** · **ATT&CK T1557**
- context: **websocket** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: state carries across frames — the replay/state-bypass classes apply frame-to-frame
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

- Handshake origin matrix (none / `null` / evil origin): 400/403 on hardened stacks = CSWSH dead at the transport — a positive control, log it.

## Probe adjustment (websocket × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
