# Metadata injection — iot-edge / guest

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/supabase-gotrue-playbook.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-supabase-gotrue-playbook-metadata-injection.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **iot-edge** · auth **guest** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `sqlmap`, `nosqlmap`, `tplmap`, `commix`, `crlfuzz`, `dotdotpwn`, `nmap-http-sqli`, `nmap-shellshock`
- chains: `fuzz`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: device-adjacent runtime at the edge — own devices, lab network
- auth state: a filter/WAF tier fronts the target: expect canonicalization and signature matching on the raw request — the probe vocabulary's encodings (double-encode, unicode, backslash, case-split) exist exactly for this tier; the differential must clear the filter WITHOUT tripping it, or the finding is a WAF flag, not a class confirmation. Low-and-slow: one variant per request, never a burst.

## The technique

`user_metadata.role=admin`, `credits:999999` persists into the JWT (GoTrue does not strip user_metadata). But backends authorize on their own DB (profiles table / app_metadata), so admin claims almost never escalate. Record persistence as confirmed; expect authorization to fail.

## Probe adjustment (iot-edge × guest)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
