# Rate limits & rotation

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/supabase-gotrue-playbook.md`

## Route

- probes: `nmap-slowloris-check`, `curl`
- chains: `web`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

Per-account ~6 req/min on media endpoints, but with phone_autoconfirm signup, rotation is trivial: mint fresh account on 429 (2s per account). Also retry "exhausted" upstream models on fresh accounts — some 429s are per-session.
