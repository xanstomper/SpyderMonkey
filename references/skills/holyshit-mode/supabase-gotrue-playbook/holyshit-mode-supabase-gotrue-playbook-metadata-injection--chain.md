# Metadata injection — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/supabase-gotrue-playbook.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-supabase-gotrue-playbook-metadata-injection.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

`user_metadata.role=admin`, `credits:999999` persists into the JWT (GoTrue does not strip user_metadata). But backends authorize on their own DB (profiles table / app_metadata), so admin claims almost never escalate. Record persistence as confirmed; expect authorization to fail.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
