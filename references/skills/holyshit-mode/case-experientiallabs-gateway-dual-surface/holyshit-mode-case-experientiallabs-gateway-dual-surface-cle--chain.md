# Clean negatives (do not re-probe) — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-experientiallabs-gateway-dual-surface.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-experientiallabs-gateway-dual-surface-cle.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `s3scanner`, `cloudbrute`, `cloudlist`, `kube-hunter`, `shodan`
- chains: `cloud-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- SSRF via inference params: `url`/`endpoint` -> timeout, `base_url` ignored.
- Cloud-role/metadata: `/metadata`, `/logs`, `/internal/status`, `/debug/zpages` all 404
  under `Host:127.0.0.1` (the Caddy loopback site returns a 200 shell, not a real proxy).
- `/kv_event_sources`: GET 200 `{}`, POST 405. No enumeration.
- Web + public-edge management: EVERY `/api/*` + `/api/orgs/<id>/*` + `/admin/*` + `/auth/*`
  server-side 401/Turnstile/session-gated. No unauth IDOR/broken-authz/mass-assignment.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
