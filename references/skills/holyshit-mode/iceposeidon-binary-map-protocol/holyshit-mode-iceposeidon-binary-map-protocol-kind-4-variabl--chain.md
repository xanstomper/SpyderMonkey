# Kind 4 — variable-length records (`en`-byte records, type table `Zd`) — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/iceposeidon-binary-map-protocol.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-iceposeidon-binary-map-protocol-kind-4-variabl.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

`recordCount` from header; each record: first byte indexes table `Zd`, followed by typed fields via `Zd[r.getUint8(...)]` descriptor. (Not fully enumerated — event was quiet.)

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
