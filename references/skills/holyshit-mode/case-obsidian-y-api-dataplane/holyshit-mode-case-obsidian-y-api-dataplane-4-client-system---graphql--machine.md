# 4. Client `system` role honored on `/pg/chat` (score 45) — graphql / machine

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-obsidian-y-api-dataplane.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-obsidian-y-api-dataplane-4-client-system-.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-SESS** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1528**
- context: **graphql** · auth **machine** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: aliases and batched queries bypass field-level checks; type confusion lives in the schema
- auth state: the principal is a SERVICE identity (API key, SA token, CI secret, webhook signing key): the differential is the KEY's resource scope — key-level vs user-level objects, cross-tenant reach, unscoped keys, and which audit trail the key leaves; the human account model does not apply

## The technique

Sending `{"role":"system","content":"..."}` in messages works — prompt_tokens jumps 6→19 (system
message added). Client controls the LLM's system context behind the untrusted proxy.

## Probe adjustment (graphql × machine)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
