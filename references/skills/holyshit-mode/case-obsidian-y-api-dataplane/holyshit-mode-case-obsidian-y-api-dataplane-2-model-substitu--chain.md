# 2. Model substitution via `served_by` (score 55) — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-obsidian-y-api-dataplane.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-obsidian-y-api-dataplane-2-model-substitu.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

The `served_by` response field reveals actual routing. All `ollama/*` requests
(`llama4`, `qwen3.8`, `gemma4-*`, `qwen3.6-35b`) returned `served_by=ollama/glm-4.7-flash` — the
router sanitizes every ollama submodel to ONE serving model. `model` reported the requested name
but `served_by` showed the real engine. Billing/model-routing flaw (ask for cheap, get fixed
model). Wildcard/empty/default/best/auto model names all 404 → no wildcard routing bypass.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
