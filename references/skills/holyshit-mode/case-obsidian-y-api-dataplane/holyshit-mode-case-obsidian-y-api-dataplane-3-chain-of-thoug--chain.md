# 3. Chain-of-thought leak — `muse/muse-glimmer` (score 50) — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-obsidian-y-api-dataplane.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-obsidian-y-api-dataplane-3-chain-of-thoug.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

`reasoning_content` field on EVERY muse response carries full hidden CoT, even for trivial math
(17*23 → narrates the working). Also leaks speculative-decoding internals:
`timings: {cache_n, draft_n, draft_n_accepted, predicted_ms}` and a concrete
`system_fingerprint: b11382-11fe02151`. No user/system secrets in the CoT here, but it's a real
instruction/privacy leak channel and confirms model internals.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
