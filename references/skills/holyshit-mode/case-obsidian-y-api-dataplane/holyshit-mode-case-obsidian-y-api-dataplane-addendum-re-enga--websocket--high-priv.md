# Addendum — re-engage #5 (2026-10-06): proxy-fleet build + empty-content hardening — websocket / high-priv

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-obsidian-y-api-dataplane.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-obsidian-y-api-dataplane-addendum-re-enga.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **websocket** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: state carries across frames — the replay/state-bypass classes apply frame-to-frame
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

The operator shifted from recon to building a USABLE proxy over the unauth `/pg/chat` vector:
`~/obsidian-proxy/obsidian_proxy.py` (port 8620). This is the durable "wrap an unauth upstream
chat vector as a local OpenAI-compatible gateway" pattern (see SKILL.md "Free-AI proxy build
pattern"). Session added:

## Probe adjustment (websocket × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
