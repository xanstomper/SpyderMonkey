# Fleet probe discipline — web-app / high-priv

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-obsidian-y-api-dataplane.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-obsidian-y-api-dataplane-fleet-probe-disc.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-INFO** · **CWE-200** · **ATT&CK T1592**
- context: **web-app** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: strike through the browser/proxy path; the 3-gate differential runs on the reflected/accepted value
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

Before wiring anything, live-probe EVERY model in `/v1/models` in parallel (submit with a
`tools` payload). Output per model: does it return real content? does it emit native
`tool_calls`? what `served_by` shows. On obsidian: 30/38 models live, 27 with native
tool-calling — the fleet is mixed. Models that live-probe 502 / empty get pruned, not assumed.

## Probe adjustment (web-app × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
