# 6. Post-breach user-protection checks (do these even when the core is clean)

## The technique

- `dig TXT _dmarc.<domain>` — `p=reject; pct=100` = spoofing dead. `p=none` or missing =
  post-breach phishing is trivially easy and becomes a critical finding.
- Full SPF (`-all` vs `~all`) + DKIM selector sweep (`default|google|s1|s2|selector1...`).
- The breach data itself drives phishing lures; the email-auth posture decides whether
  attackers can send AS the domain. This is the live risk while the extortion clock runs.
