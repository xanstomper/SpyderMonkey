# 6. Post-breach user-protection checks (do these even when the core is clean)

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-gamdom-adjacent-infra.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- generated: 2026-11-04

## Route

- probes: `nmap-smtp-commands`, `nmap-smtp-enum-users`, `swaks`, `dig-mx`, `dig-txt`
- chains: `mail-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- `dig TXT _dmarc.<domain>` — `p=reject; pct=100` = spoofing dead. `p=none` or missing =
  post-breach phishing is trivially easy and becomes a critical finding.
- Full SPF (`-all` vs `~all`) + DKIM selector sweep (`default|google|s1|s2|selector1...`).
- The breach data itself drives phishing lures; the email-auth posture decides whether
  attackers can send AS the domain. This is the live risk while the extortion clock runs.
