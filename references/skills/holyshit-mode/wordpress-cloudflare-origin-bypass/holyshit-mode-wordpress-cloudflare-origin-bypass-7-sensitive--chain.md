# 7. Sensitive-file soft-404 discriminator (don't false-positive) — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/wordpress-cloudflare-origin-bypass.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-wordpress-cloudflare-origin-bypass-7-sensitive.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

On this origin, every missing path under `.env.bak`, `/.htpasswd`, `/backup.zip`, `/dump.sql`,
`/.git/config`, `/wp-config.php` returned **`200 text/html`** with the same generic
"DOCTYPE html / charset=utf8 / viewport" page. That identical template is a **custom soft-404**,
NOT file content. Discriminate by body: real secrets would differ / be smaller; an identical
shell = file does not exist. A plain `st==200` is a false-positive trap.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
