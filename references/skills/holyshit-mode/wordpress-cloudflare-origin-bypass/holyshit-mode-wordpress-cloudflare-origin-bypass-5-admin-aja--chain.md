# 5. Admin-ajax unauth action sweep — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/wordpress-cloudflare-origin-bypass.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-wordpress-cloudflare-origin-bypass-5-admin-aja.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

Many plugins register `wp_ajax_nopriv_*` handlers that are genuinely public. Sweep:
`POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with `action=<name>` for each plugin's likely handler names.
- `200` + meaningful JSON = LIVE unauth handler (hit the jackpot).
- `200` body `0` or `-1` = handler ran but dismissed/empty (still registered → tune params).
- `400` = no such handler.
On d 400 — origin is uniformly gated.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
