# Phase 1: Host Discovery — iac / high-priv

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/recon-technique-multi-host-brute.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-recon-technique-multi-host-brute-phase-1-host-.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-09** · **CWE-350** · **ATT&CK T1584**
- context: **iac** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `s3scanner`, `cloudbrute`, `cloudlist`, `kube-hunter`, `shodan`
- chains: `cloud-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: template/state files are the infrastructure inventory — read-only crown of the exposure
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

- Subdomain brute-force using a short AI-infra wordlist: `api`, `doc`, `internal`, `status`, `staging`, `metrics`, etc.
- Hit: `internal.freeinference.org` → 107.173.46.170 (non-Cloudflare IP — separate infra tier, ports filtered)
- Hits: `doc.`, `staging.`, `status.` → Cloudflare-protected hosts
- Note: DNS resolution of internal/ staging/ status subdomains is itself an info leak (infra topology exposure)

## Probe adjustment (iac × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
