# Phase 5: Rate-Limit Probing (The Critical Gap) — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/recon-technique-multi-host-brute.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-recon-technique-multi-host-brute-phase-5-rate-.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- `/api/dashboard` and `/api/export` return 401 on wrong password with **ZERO rate limiting**
- 20 rapid wrong-password attempts → all 401, zero 429
- Contrast: `/auth/signup` on main domain has working rate limiting (429 after 10 attempts)
- The rate-limit inconsistency between openinfra (unguarded) and f***REDACTED***.org (guarded) is the vulnerability pattern

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
