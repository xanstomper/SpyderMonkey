# Phase 6: Brute-Force Execution

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/recon-technique-multi-host-brute.md`
- bindings: **MASTG-RES** · **CWE-288** · **ATT&CK T1557**
- generated: 2026-11-04

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- `x-export-password` brute-forced with trivial wordlist — password `madsys` matched on 7th attempt
- Same password worked on `x-refresh-password` — credential reuse confirmed
- Password is the Harvard MaDSys Lab team name — trivially guessable by anyone reading the status page or docs footer
- 20 rapid wrong-password probes returned zero 429s across both endpoints
