# Applicable Vector Matrix Cells — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/recon-technique-multi-host-brute.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-recon-technique-multi-host-brute-applicable-ve.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- G.INFRA/CLOUD — public telemetry endpoint with no rate limit
- E.CLIENT — client-side secrets in JS bundles (shared-secret auth pattern)
- C.WEB-APP-AUTHZ — hidden endpoints with single shared secret, no MFA

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
