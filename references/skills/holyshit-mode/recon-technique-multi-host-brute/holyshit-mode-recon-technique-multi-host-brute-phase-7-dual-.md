# Phase 7: Dual Auth-Path Testing

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/recon-technique-multi-host-brute.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**

## The technique

- Tested JWT forge, CRLF injection, X-API-Key vs Bearer header variants
- JWT forge rejected (401), CRLF injection rejected (401, no header injection — parser is safe)
- Main `/v1/chat/completions` accepts both `Authorization: Bearer` and `X-API-Key` — dual auth path but both properly key-gated
