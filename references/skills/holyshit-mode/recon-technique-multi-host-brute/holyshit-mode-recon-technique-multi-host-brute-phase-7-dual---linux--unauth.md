# Phase 7: Dual Auth-Path Testing — linux / unauth

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/recon-technique-multi-host-brute.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-recon-technique-multi-host-brute-phase-7-dual-.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **linux** · auth **unauth** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `sqlmap`, `nosqlmap`, `tplmap`, `commix`, `crlfuzz`, `dotdotpwn`, `nmap-http-sqli`, `nmap-shellshock`
- chains: `fuzz`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: read-only inventory first (kaisha rungs), then the documented class match
- auth state: no credential material — the classic differential applies as-is; absent auth = the authn-bypass class

## The technique

- Tested JWT forge, CRLF injection, X-API-Key vs Bearer header variants
- JWT forge rejected (401), CRLF injection rejected (401, no header injection — parser is safe)
- Main `/v1/chat/completions` accepts both `Authorization: Bearer` and `X-API-Key` — dual auth path but both properly key-gated

## Probe adjustment (linux × unauth)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
