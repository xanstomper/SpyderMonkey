# 4. Verifying an exposed archive before declaring a DB leak — container / guest

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/control-escalation-negatives.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-control-escalation-negatives-4-verifying-an-ex.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-04** · **CWE-530** · **ATT&CK T1552**
- context: **container** · auth **guest** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: namespace/capability surface — read-only inventory, no escape execution
- auth state: a filter/WAF tier fronts the target: expect canonicalization and signature matching on the raw request — the probe vocabulary's encodings (double-encode, unicode, backslash, case-split) exist exactly for this tier; the differential must clear the filter WITHOUT tripping it, or the finding is a WAF flag, not a class confirmation. Low-and-slow: one variant per request, never a burst.

## The technique

Download a candidate backup with a Range header first (`Range: bytes=0-200`), check the magic
(`PK` = zip), then pull full bytes and list `zipfile.namelist()` + `getinfo().file_size`. A `.zip`
whose members are all `.jpg`/media is a photo archive, not a credentials dump. Don't report "DB
backup exposed" from the filename alone.

## Probe adjustment (container × guest)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
