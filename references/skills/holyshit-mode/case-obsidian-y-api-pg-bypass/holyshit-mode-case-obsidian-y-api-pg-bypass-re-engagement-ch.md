# Re-engagement checklist

## The technique

- Re-test `/pg/chat` first (502 = upstreams down, 401/404 = patched — the bypass may be fixed;
  re-verify before trusting this case).
- If patched: check whether /playground still exists and whether the proxy now requires a
  session cookie or Referer/Origin header instead of a key.
- Try the vercel.app vantage for `/pg/chat` equivalence.
- Reasoning-field extraction for the 50k system prompt (stream with reasoning models, dump
  `reasoning_details`).
