# Re-engagement checklist — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-obsidian-y-api-pg-bypass.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-obsidian-y-api-pg-bypass-re-engagement-ch.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- Re-test `/pg/chat` first (502 = upstreams down, 401/404 = patched — the bypass may be fixed;
  re-verify before trusting this case).
- If patched: check whether /playground still exists and whether the proxy now requires a
  session cookie or Referer/Origin header instead of a key.
- Try the vercel.app vantage for `/pg/chat` equivalence.
- Reasoning-field extraction for the 50k system prompt (stream with reasoning models, dump
  `reasoning_details`).

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
