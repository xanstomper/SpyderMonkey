# Rate Limiter Behavior (2026-10-09 updated) — aws / federated

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-logfare-ai.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-logfare-ai-rate-limiter-behavior-2026-10-.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **aws** · auth **federated** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `s3scanner`, `cloudbrute`, `cloudlist`, `kube-hunter`, `shodan`
- chains: `cloud-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: IAM/identity surface — read-only enumeration (shukaku hunt semantics)
- auth state: identity rides an external IdP (OAuth/OIDC/SAML/SSO): the differential is the TOKEN — audience, issuer, redirect_uri, scope downgrades, code/state reuse, and the exchange at the resource server; the local session may be fine while the trust boundary is not

## The technique

- `/v1/auth/login`: 10 requests then 429 (retry-after header present)
- `/v1/auth/register`: 429 after burst, blocked by IP (retry-after: 45)
- `/v1/chat/completions`: No rate limit on 15 rapid requests with Bearer token
- `/v1/models`: No rate limit (public endpoint)
- X-Forwarded-For spoofing → Cloudflare 403 error 1000 (rate limiter bound to real IP, not spoofable header)
- **429 responses include CORS headers** → brute-force from browser can read rate-limit timing

## Probe adjustment (aws × federated)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
