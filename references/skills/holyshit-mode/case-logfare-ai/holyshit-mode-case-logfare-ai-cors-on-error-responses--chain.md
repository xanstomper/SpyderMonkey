# CORS on Error Responses — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-logfare-ai.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-logfare-ai-cors-on-error-responses.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

The CORS headers (`access-control-allow-origin: <any>`, `access-control-allow-credentials: true`)
are present on ALL response codes including 401/403/404/405/429. This means a malicious site
can send requests to destructive endpoints and read the error responses, confirming server-side
processing even when blocked.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
