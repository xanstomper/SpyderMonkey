# USAGE RULES — ci-cd / machine

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/detection-evasion-modules.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-detection-evasion-modules-usage-rules.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **ci-cd** · auth **machine** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `s3scanner`, `cloudbrute`, `cloudlist`, `kube-hunter`, `shodan`
- chains: `cloud-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: pipeline config/runner surface — secrets and lateral movement ride the runners
- auth state: the principal is a SERVICE identity (API key, SA token, CI secret, webhook signing key): the differential is the KEY's resource scope — key-level vs user-level objects, cross-tenant reach, unscoped keys, and which audit trail the key leaves; the human account model does not apply

## The technique

- Every module requires explicit stealth-validation scope in the authorization document.
- Each technique is run once, logged with timestamp, and reverted immediately after
  validation.
- The output is a detection-gap report: technique → expected detection → observed
  detection → proposed analytic (Sigma/KNQL/CloudWatch rule).
- No module is used against production users or data — lab tenants, test accounts, and
  scoped resources only.

## Probe adjustment (ci-cd × machine)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
