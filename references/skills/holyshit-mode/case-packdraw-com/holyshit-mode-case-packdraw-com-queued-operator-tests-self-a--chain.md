# Queued operator tests (self-account, non-destructive) — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-packdraw-com.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-packdraw-com-queued-operator-tests-self-a.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

1. **Seed-rotation test** (the top finding): register → open 2 cheap packs → record
   pre-open hashed seed + post-open revealed seed for each; check (a) hash(revealed) ==
   pre-open hash (commitment discipline), (b) seeds differ between opens (rotation), or
   (c) same seed persists (PREDICTIVE → guaranteed-win exploit).
2. **Battle verification**: join/observe one battle → after EOS block, verify
   `sha256(blockHash) → ticket → winner` against the recorded winner.
3. **Cross-user Pusher**: with an account, request `/api/pusher/auth` for
   `private-encrypted-user-<OTHER>` channel → 403 = good; 200 = cross-user realtime.
4. **Create-pack validation**: user-created packs — can the user set odds/weights/price
   such that EV > price (self-dealing), or is validation server-side?
5. **Tokenize iframe config** POST shape (may leak tokenExId/timestamp config).

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
