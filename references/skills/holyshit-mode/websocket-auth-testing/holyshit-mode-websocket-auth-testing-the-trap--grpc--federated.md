# The Trap — grpc / federated

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/websocket-auth-testing.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-websocket-auth-testing-the-trap.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **grpc** · auth **federated** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: reflection/list methods first; protobuf definitions are the schema oracle
- auth state: identity rides an external IdP (OAuth/OIDC/SAML/SSO): the differential is the TOKEN — audience, issuer, redirect_uri, scope downgrades, code/state reuse, and the exchange at the resource server; the local session may be fine while the trust boundary is not

## The technique

```bash
curl -i -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" \
     -H "Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==" \
     -H "Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13" \
     https://target/api/voice/socket
```

You get `HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols` and think "no auth required!" That conclusion
is wrong. The 101 is the CDN/proxy doing its job. The origin server has not yet seen
ANY application data.

## Probe adjustment (grpc × federated)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
