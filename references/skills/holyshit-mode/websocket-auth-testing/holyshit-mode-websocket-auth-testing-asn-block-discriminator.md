# ASN-block discriminator (block page ≠ solvable challenge)

## The technique

A 403 "Attention Required!" that PERSISTS for a real headless chromium while
`cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/...` assets return 200 is an ASN/datacenter block, not
a challenge — the JS runs, the wall stays. No header/TLS/cookie stack clears it; the
plane is reachable only from residential egress, which is a sanctioned-vantage
decision for the operator, never a home-IP technique. Record the class negative
with the discriminator evidence and move on.
