# The Trap — edge-node / root

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/websocket-auth-testing.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-websocket-auth-testing-the-trap.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **edge-node** · auth **root** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: cdn/origin edge — cache key and origin-pull trust are the class surface
- auth state: the highest local principal — confirm the class from the top down (downgrade/view-as tests, no-gain reads are the crown)

## The technique

```bash
curl -i -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" \
     -H "Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==" \
     -H "Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13" \
     https://target/api/voice/socket
```

You get `HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols` and think "no auth required!" That conclusion
is wrong. The 101 is the CDN/proxy doing its job. The origin server has not yet seen
ANY application data.

## Probe adjustment (edge-node × root)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
