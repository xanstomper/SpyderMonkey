# 1. Namespace discovery — wait for the rejection frame — api / federated

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/websocket-auth-testing.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-websocket-auth-testing-1-namespace-discovery-w.md`
- bindings: **PTES-PE** · **CWE-522** · **ATT&CK T1555**
- context: **api** · auth **federated** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-slowloris-check`, `curl`
- chains: `web`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: strike the JSON body + query string; content-type and parameter placement change the probe shape
- auth state: identity rides an external IdP (OAuth/OIDC/SAML/SSO): the differential is the TOKEN — audience, issuer, redirect_uri, scope downgrades, code/state reuse, and the exchange at the resource server; the local session may be fine while the trust boundary is not

## The technique

Unknown namespaces STILL ack `40` (connected) immediately; the server sends
`44<ns>,"Invalid namespace"` only after ~1-2 seconds. A recv window shorter than
that misreads EVERY namespace as live. Connect, then listen ≥2s per namespace and
classify: `40<ns>,` kept = real, `44` follows = rejected.

Then map the RPC layer — socket.io apps often route RPCs over HTTP as a SEPARATE
surface (`POST /stream<ns>/rpc/<method>` with body `{"type":"rpc","arg":...}`).
Existence oracle: unknown method → literal `unknown rpc`; live method, bad args →
`Invalid parameters`; dead namespace path → Express `Cannot POST`. Cross the two
axes for a full method×namespace map with zero credentials.

## Probe adjustment (api × federated)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
