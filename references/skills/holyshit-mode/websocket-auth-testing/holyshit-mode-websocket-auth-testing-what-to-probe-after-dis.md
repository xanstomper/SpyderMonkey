# What to Probe After Discovering the Auth Pattern

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/websocket-auth-testing.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-06** · **CWE-294** · **ATT&CK T1550**
- generated: 2026-11-07

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

| Vector | Test |
|--------|------|
| Token reuse across users | Get token as user A, use on user B's resources |
| Token replay | Use the same token twice |
| Token expiry | Wait 5/30/60 min, retry |
| Token forgery | Guess the structure (UUID? JWT? random?) |
| Session-cookie substitute | Send session cookie in upgrade headers, skip token frame |
| Mass assignment on token source | POST `/api/.../session` with `{"unlimited":true,"isAdmin":true}` |
| Origin bypass | Strip Origin header from upgrade request |
| First-frame type confusion | Send `{"type":"ready"}` instead of `{"type":"authenticate",...}` |
