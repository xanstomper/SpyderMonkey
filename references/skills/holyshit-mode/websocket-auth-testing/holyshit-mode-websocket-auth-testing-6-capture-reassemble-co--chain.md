# 6. Capture: reassemble continuation frames, sanitize binaries — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/websocket-auth-testing.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-websocket-auth-testing-6-capture-reassemble-co.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

Large socket.io events fragment across websocket frames (continuations, opcode 0).
A recv loop that treats one frame per message splices JSON at ~4KB boundaries and
"Unterminated string" parse errors. Read one FULL message per recv: loop until the
FIN bit, merging opcode-0 payloads into the opcode-1 message. Pongs and other
binary frames arrive as 2-byte opcodes mid-stream — strip `\x00-\x1f` control
bytes from captured text before any JSON parse. A mis-reassembled capture will make
a 90KB `initialize` event parse as a 4KB stub — size-check messages before
trusting field counts.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
