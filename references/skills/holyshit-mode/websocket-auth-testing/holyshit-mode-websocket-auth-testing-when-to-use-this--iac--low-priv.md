# When to Use This — iac / low-priv

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/websocket-auth-testing.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-websocket-auth-testing-when-to-use-this.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **iac** · auth **low-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `s3scanner`, `cloudbrute`, `cloudlist`, `kube-hunter`, `shodan`
- chains: `cloud-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: template/state files are the infrastructure inventory — read-only crown of the exposure
- auth state: hold ONE low-priv principal; swap object ids/roles upward only (idor/authz classes)

## The technique

- Target has any WebSocket endpoint (voice, chat, live updates, gaming, trading).
- Target is behind a CDN that proxies WebSocket (Cloudflare, CloudFront, Fastly).
- You see `socketUrl` or `new WebSocket(` in the JS bundle.
- The endpoint appears to accept unauthenticated upgrades (this is normal and
  does NOT mean it's vulnerable — keep probing).

## Probe adjustment (iac × low-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
