# CDN-Specific Gotchas

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/websocket-auth-testing.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- generated: 2026-11-04

## Route

- probes: `s3scanner`, `cloudbrute`, `cloudlist`, `kube-hunter`, `shodan`
- chains: `cloud-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- **Cloudflare**: forwards the 101 upgrade transparently. The origin server sees
  the upgrade as a normal WebSocket. Spoofing `X-Forwarded-For`/`CF-Connecting-IP`
  on the upgrade returns `403 error 1000` — Cloudflare strips client-supplied IPs
  before proxying. IP rotation to bypass rate limits is NOT possible.

- **AWS CloudFront**: similar passthrough behavior. Check `via:` header to confirm
  CDN presence.

- **Origin behind multiple proxies**: the upgrade may pass through 2+ hops; auth
  may be enforced at any hop. If frames are rejected with no clear pattern,
  check whether the CDN itself is doing auth (e.g. Cloudflare Access).
