# 4. Sid bearer-attach test — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/websocket-auth-testing.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-websocket-auth-testing-4-sid-bearer-attach-tes.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

engine.io sessions authenticate by sid alone unless the app binds them server-side:
open a SECOND websocket against a LIVE session's sid (`?...&sid=<victim sid>`).
`101 Switching Protocols` + answered pings = the sid is a single-secret bearer
credential. The websocket Origin allowlist is client-asserted (header VALUE
comparison at handshake) — trivially faked from non-browser clients, so it does not
protect the session. A leaked sid (access logs, any reflection) on an AUTHED socket
= full event-stream takeover. Remediation to state: bind socket sessions to the HTTP
session cookie server-side (reject connections whose cookie doesn't match the
handshake session).

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
