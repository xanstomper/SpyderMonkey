# 8. Impersonated WS clients in practice (curl_cffi) — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/websocket-auth-testing.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-websocket-auth-testing-8-impersonated-ws-clien.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

`Session(impersonate="chrome110")` is the practical client for CF-fronted WS testing:

- **Warm the jar before the upgrade**: a bare `ws_connect` with browser TLS but no
  cookie history gets CF 403; the SAME Session after one `GET https://target/`
  (which receives `__cf_bm`) passes the upgrade. The clearance is cookie-carried,
  not TLS-carried — an "impersonation failed" verdict without a warmed jar is a
  false negative.
- **One Session per probe**: session jars accumulate CF cookies until requests die
  with 431 "Header Value Too Long" (the error names the culprit header).
- **Cookies iterate as name strings**, not Cookie objects — `dict(s.cookies)` for
  name→value.
- **Capture the handshake without raw CDP**: playwright `page.on('websocket')` →
  `ws.on('framesent')`/`ws.on('framereceived')` on a real page load reveals the
  client's exact opening bytes — replicate those byte-for-byte instead of guessing
  packet shapes.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
