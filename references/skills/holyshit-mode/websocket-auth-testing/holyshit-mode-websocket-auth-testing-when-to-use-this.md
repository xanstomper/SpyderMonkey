# When to Use This

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/websocket-auth-testing.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- generated: 2026-11-04

## Route

- probes: `s3scanner`, `cloudbrute`, `cloudlist`, `kube-hunter`, `shodan`
- chains: `cloud-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- Target has any WebSocket endpoint (voice, chat, live updates, gaming, trading).
- Target is behind a CDN that proxies WebSocket (Cloudflare, CloudFront, Fastly).
- You see `socketUrl` or `new WebSocket(` in the JS bundle.
- The endpoint appears to accept unauthenticated upgrades (this is normal and
  does NOT mean it's vulnerable — keep probing).
