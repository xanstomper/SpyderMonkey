# CDN-Specific Gotchas — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/websocket-auth-testing.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-websocket-auth-testing-cdn-specific-gotchas.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- **Cloudflare**: forwards the 101 upgrade transparently. The origin server sees
  the upgrade as a normal WebSocket. Spoofing `X-Forwarded-For`/`CF-Connecting-IP`
  on the upgrade returns `403 error 1000` — Cloudflare strips client-supplied IPs
  before proxying. IP rotation to bypass rate limits is NOT possible.

- **AWS CloudFront**: similar passthrough behavior. Check `via:` header to confirm
  CDN presence.

- **Origin behind multiple proxies**: the upgrade may pass through 2+ hops; auth
  may be enforced at any hop. If frames are rejected with no clear pattern,
  check whether the CDN itself is doing auth (e.g. Cloudflare Access).

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
