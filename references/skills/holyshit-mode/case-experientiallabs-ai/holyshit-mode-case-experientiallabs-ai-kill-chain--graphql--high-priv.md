# Kill-chain — graphql / high-priv

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-experientiallabs-ai.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-experientiallabs-ai-kill-chain.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **graphql** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: aliases and batched queries bypass field-level checks; type confusion lives in the schema
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

Recon (keyless catalog + SPF + DNS) → internal-fleet enumeration (`*.xplabs.ai` base_url leak
in `/api/models`) → internal control-plane discovery (`/openapi.json`) → **unauth free-AI
inference (`/invocations`, premium models) + unauth elastic-scaling control-plane
(`/scale_elastic_ep`) = Impact**.

## Probe adjustment (graphql × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
