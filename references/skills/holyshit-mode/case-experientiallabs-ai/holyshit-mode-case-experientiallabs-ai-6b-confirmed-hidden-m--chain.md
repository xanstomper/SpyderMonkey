# 6b. CONFIRMED — Hidden-model catalog leak (prod + staging) (score 55) — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-experientiallabs-ai.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-experientiallabs-ai-6b-confirmed-hidden-m.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- **Prod catalog (`/api/models`):** `gpt-6-astra-2026-09-03-private` (literally "private", azure_openai).
- **Staging catalog (`api.staging.../api/models`):** `ox-alpha` = provider `openrouter`, provider_model_id
  **`stealth/ox-alpha`** — a hidden/stealth model; plus `-latest` rolling aliases.
- **IMPACT:** Keyless disclosure of models an org cannot/should not access, and the stealth/private
  internal catalog naming. Recon/observation (maps the hidden tier), not direct compromise.
- **CONFIDENCE:** High (raw keyless JSON).

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
