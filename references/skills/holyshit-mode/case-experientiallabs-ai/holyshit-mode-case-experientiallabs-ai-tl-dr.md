# TL;DR

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-experientiallabs-ai.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- generated: 2026-11-04

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

The operator's public gateway (`api.experientiallabs.ai`) is well-hardened — every `/v1/*`
inference route 401s without a valid `xpl_` key, the management API is session/org-gated, and
the Next.js admin console is auth-routed. However, the **internal serving fleet** under
`*.xplabs.ai` leaks heavily and exposes an **unauthenticated elastic-scaling control-plane
write** on the DeepSeek lane — a real compromise.
