# 4. CONFIRMED — Keyless internal usage/billing ledger leak on `gateway.xplabs.ai` (score 70) — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-experientiallabs-ai.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-experientiallabs-ai-4-confirmed-keyless-i.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- **EVIDENCE:** `GET https://gateway.xplabs.ai/usage.json` (no auth) returns full internal
  ledger: `organization_id:"local"`, totals + per-`identity` breakdown.
- **Identities leaked keyless:** `kion-unlimited`, `opflow`, `platform`, `vincent`
  (internal serving tenant/account names) with per-identity requests, token counts, and
  **known_estimated_cost_micro_usd** (total ~`1,753,588` µUSD ≈ $1.75).
- `GET /usage` also serves a human HTML page of the same ledger.
- **IMPACT:** Internal account-name enumeration + wallet/usage/spend exposure on operator-
  owned infra. Feeds further targeted abuse (tenant enumeration).
- **CONFIDENCE:** High — raw JSON keys verified.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
