# Re-verification of prior confirmeds (doctrine: patch-check FIRST) — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-logfare-ai-retest2.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-logfare-ai-retest2-re-verification-of-pri.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- **CORS reflection SURVIVED** on every endpoint incl. state-changers:
  `/v1/models`, `/login`, `/register`, `/dashboard`, `/v1/chat/completions` (405 but
  headers present), `POST /v1/auth/regenerate-key`, `/v1/me/delete`, `/v1/me/opt-out` —
  all reflect `access-control-allow-origin: https://evil.com` +
  `access-control-allow-credentials: true` (vary: Origin).
- **BUT auth model changed** to cookie sessions. Observed cookie flags
  (`/v1/auth/discord/start`):
  `logfare_discord_oauth_state=...; HttpOnly; Max-Age=600; Path=/v1/auth/discord; SameSite=lax; Secure`
  SameSite=Lax blocks cross-site POST cookies → prior CVSS ~9.1 downgraded to ~7.1
  (cross-site GET/top-level-nav exposure + misconfig lint, not session hijack).
  Authenticated matrix (real login cookie SameSite, IDOR, regenerate CSRF) needs a session.
- **openapi.json still 200** (24.5KB, 60+ routes, no security schemes declared), /docs public.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
