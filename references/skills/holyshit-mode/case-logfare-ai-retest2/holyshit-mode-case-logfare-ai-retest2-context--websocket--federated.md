# Context — websocket / federated

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-logfare-ai-retest2.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-logfare-ai-retest2-context.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **websocket** · auth **federated** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: state carries across frames — the replay/state-bypass classes apply frame-to-frame
- auth state: identity rides an external IdP (OAuth/OIDC/SAML/SSO): the differential is the TOKEN — audience, issuer, redirect_uri, scope downgrades, code/state reuse, and the exchange at the resource server; the local session may be fine while the trust boundary is not

## The technique

Second engagement of logfare.ai (baseline 2026-10-03: CORS arbitrary-origin + credentials
CVSS ~9.1, broken rate limiting, FastAPI openapi.json exposure). Target rebuilt since
baseline: SPA → server-rendered FastAPI (inline `<script>` blocks, no hashed JS bundle),
plus a NEW OAuth-provider surface (`/oauth/authorize`, `/v1/me/apps`, device flow).

## Probe adjustment (websocket × federated)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
