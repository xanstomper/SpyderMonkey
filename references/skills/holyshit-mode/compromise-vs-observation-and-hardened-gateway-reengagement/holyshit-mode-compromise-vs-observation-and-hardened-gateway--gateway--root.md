# 1. Re-verify the prior "holy shits" are patched FIRST (findings decay hourly) — gateway / root

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/compromise-vs-observation-and-hardened-gateway-reengagement.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-compromise-vs-observation-and-hardened-gateway.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**
- context: **gateway** · auth **root** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: api/front-door tier — routing and authn decisions here are the differential
- auth state: the highest local principal — confirm the class from the top down (downgrade/view-as tests, no-gain reads are the crown)

## The technique

- **Shared-buffer cross-user disclosure / context poisoning patch check = PTOK-drift oracle:**
  fire 3+ identical 1-word requests spaced ~3s apart, read `usage.prompt_tokens`. Constant
  (e.g. 6) = stateless/patched. DRIFTING/growing = shared global buffer re-emerged = the
  highest-value re-find. Do this before anything else; the ledger `negative` rows may predate
  a redeploy that brought the vuln back.

## Probe adjustment (gateway × root)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
