# 1. Re-verify the prior "holy shits" are patched FIRST (findings decay hourly) — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/compromise-vs-observation-and-hardened-gateway-reengagement.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-compromise-vs-observation-and-hardened-gateway.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- **Shared-buffer cross-user disclosure / context poisoning patch check = PTOK-drift oracle:**
  fire 3+ identical 1-word requests spaced ~3s apart, read `usage.prompt_tokens`. Constant
  (e.g. 6) = stateless/patched. DRIFTING/growing = shared global buffer re-emerged = the
  highest-value re-find. Do this before anything else; the ledger `negative` rows may predate
  a redeploy that brought the vuln back.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
