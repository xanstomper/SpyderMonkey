# 5. Open WooCommerce store API behind the mask — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/cf-wp-origin-bypass-recipe.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-cf-wp-origin-bypass-recipe-5-open-woocommerce-.md`
- chain role: **final — this CLOSES a chain: shukaku prices what it reaches; chain detect looks for the entries that feed it**

## Chain roles

- final — this CLOSES a chain: shukaku prices what it reaches; chain detect looks for the entries that feed it

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

`/wp-json/wc/store/v1/products` (full catalog), `/cart`, `/products/attributes` serve openly
with no auth/no nonce. Checkout (`/checkout`) is POST-reachable and responds to validation
(400 `Missing parameter(s): billing_address`) but **cart add-item and checkout need a nonce**
(`woocommerce_rest_missing_nonce`) — so no order can be created without an authenticated
session. This is the boundary for "customer info" on a masked WC shop: catalog open, orders
gated.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
