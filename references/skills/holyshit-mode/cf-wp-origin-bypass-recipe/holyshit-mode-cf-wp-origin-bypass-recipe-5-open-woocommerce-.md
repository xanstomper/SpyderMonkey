# 5. Open WooCommerce store API behind the mask

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/cf-wp-origin-bypass-recipe.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHZ-04** · **CWE-639** · **ATT&CK T1068**

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

`/wp-json/wc/store/v1/products` (full catalog), `/cart`, `/products/attributes` serve openly
with no auth/no nonce. Checkout (`/checkout`) is POST-reachable and responds to validation
(400 `Missing parameter(s): billing_address`) but **cart add-item and checkout need a nonce**
(`woocommerce_rest_missing_nonce`) — so no order can be created without an authenticated
session. This is the boundary for "customer info" on a masked WC shop: catalog open, orders
gated.

## Family use

- decisive-test shape lives in the source canon
- walls: validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
