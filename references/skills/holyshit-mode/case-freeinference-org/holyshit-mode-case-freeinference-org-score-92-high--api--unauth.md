# Score: 92 (High) — api / unauth

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-freeinference-org.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-freeinference-org-score-92-high.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-04** · **CWE-798** · **ATT&CK T1552**
- context: **api** · auth **unauth** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: strike the JSON body + query string; content-type and parameter placement change the probe shape
- auth state: no credential material — the classic differential applies as-is; absent auth = the authn-bypass class

## The technique

- **E** (Exploitability): 9 — trivial wordlist brute, no tooling required
- **I** (Impact): 9 — full infra topology + live utilization + traffic volumes
- **L** (Likelihood): 8 — password `madsys` found on 7th attempt; real password likely equally weak
- **R** (Reproducibility): 9 — single curl with correct password returns 6.3MB
- **N** (Novelty): 7 — shared-secret telemetry endpoint is a distinct pattern, but brute-without-rate-limit is classic OWASP

## Probe adjustment (api × unauth)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
