# Final state — mobile-api / high-priv

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-obsidian-y-api-reengage5-provider-wiring.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-obsidian-y-api-reengage5-provider-wiring-.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**
- context: **mobile-api** · auth **high-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: the mobile client IS another api principal — same routes, different trust assumptions
- auth state: the baseline IS the privileged session; test downgrade paths (mass-assign, state-bypass)

## The technique

- `http://localhost:8620` playground; `http://10.0.0.142:8620/v1` LAN API; any key works.
- Hermes provider `obsidian-free` + 2-entry fallback chain. 30 live models, 27 tool-capable.
- holyleadger next-actions for this target: treat pg_shared_context/poisoning as decayed —
  re-verify with fresh PTOK drift before re-asserting.

## Probe adjustment (mobile-api × high-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
