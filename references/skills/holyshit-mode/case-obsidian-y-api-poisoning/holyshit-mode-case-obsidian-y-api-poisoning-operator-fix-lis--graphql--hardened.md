# Operator fix list (delivered) — graphql / hardened

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-obsidian-y-api-poisoning.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-obsidian-y-api-poisoning-operator-fix-lis.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**
- context: **graphql** · auth **hardened** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: aliases and batched queries bypass field-level checks; type confusion lives in the schema
- auth state: a filter/WAF tier fronts the target: expect canonicalization and signature matching on the raw request — the probe vocabulary's encodings (double-encode, unicode, backslash, case-split) exist exactly for this tier; the differential must clear the filter WITHOUT tripping it, or the finding is a WAF flag, not a class confirmation. Low-and-slow: one variant per request, never a burst.

## The technique

1. Per-user/per-session conversation state (random session key per browser or no history); flush the poisoned buffer on deploy. Collapses findings 95/85.
2. Session-gate + IP rate-limit /pg/*. Collapses 90/70.
3. Move character/persona data out of system prompt into per-request injection.
4. Auth-gate /status?json=1.

## Probe adjustment (graphql × hardened)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
