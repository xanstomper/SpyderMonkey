# Supabase JS client — bundle ships truncated anon key placeholder

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/oauth-redirect-uri-impact-gate.md`

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

When the SPA uses `@supabase/supabase-js` with the pattern `createClient(url, anonKey)`, some builds ship the anon key as a **truncated placeholder** in the bundle:

```js
var Kr=`https://auth.TARGET`, qr=`eyJhbG...YuCQ`
//                                        ^^^ literal "..." — not the real key
```

The real key is injected at runtime from environment / a separate config fetch. Don't waste time trying to extract a full key from the bundle when you see `...` in the middle — verify by checking the byte length (real Supabase anon keys are ~169-220 chars; a truncated placeholder is visibly shorter). If the bundle has a placeholder, the key comes from elsewhere (build-time env, edge function, or a `/api/config` endpoint).
