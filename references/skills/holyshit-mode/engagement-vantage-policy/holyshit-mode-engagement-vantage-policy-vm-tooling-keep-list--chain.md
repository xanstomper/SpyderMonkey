# VM tooling (keep list current) — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/engagement-vantage-policy.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-engagement-vantage-policy-vm-tooling-keep-list.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

python3.9, curl, dig, openssl, jq, nc/ncat, whois, nmap. OL9 = dnf; sudo -n works.
Recon kit added since: `curl-impersonate-chrome` in `~/dkv-venv/bin` (JA3 bypass, see
TLS-impersonation section), chromium-browser + Xvfb (`DISPLAY=:99`, CDP `127.0.0.1:9222`,
profile `/tmp/chrome-prof`) for real-browser surfaces, user-level pip packages in
`~/dkv-venv` (websocket-client, msgpack, eth-account, python-socketio, requests). Kill
chromium with `pkill -9 chromium` and relaunch fresh with `--no-sandbox` + a new
`--user-data-dir` when it gets stuck in an existing-session loop.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
