# Mass-assignment: confirmed, NOT exploitable (gate re-confirmed) — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-gonka-api.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-gonka-api-mass-assignment-confirmed-not-e.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- `/auth/v1/signup` `data:{role:"admin",is_admin:true,balance:999999,tier:"enterprise"}`
  persists VERBATIM into `user_metadata`, survives email confirmation into the
  verified JWT. `app_metadata` stays clean (GoTrue protects it).
- Gate: PostgREST RLS ignores `user_metadata`; edge-function billing reads real
  `balances.credits_cents` — a 2000-token completion deducted −0.002 from the
  20¢ balance. No backend authorizes on `user_metadata.role`. Score ~55
  hardening note, not a holy shit.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
