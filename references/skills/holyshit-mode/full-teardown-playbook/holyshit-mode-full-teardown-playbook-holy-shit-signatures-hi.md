# HOLY SHIT SIGNATURES — highest-yield quick checks (one probe each)

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/full-teardown-playbook.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**
- generated: 2026-11-07

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

1. Dangling CNAME → takeover
2. Deployed .map sourcemap → full source
3. Ghost route with no auth (content-type verified)
4. ?token= / ?discord_token= URL param session fixation
5. Metadata endpoint SSRF (169.254.169.254)
6. Stateless claim/verification gate (no server callback anywhere)
7. Client-only payment/credits/permission gate
8. Zero-call-site auth scaffolding (unwired gate = lockout or bypass depending on direction)
9. Public bucket with creds/backups
10. Rate limiter keyed to a header you control (X-Forwarded-For honored = unlimited budget)
