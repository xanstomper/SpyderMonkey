# PHASE 5 — AUTH & FLOW ANALYSIS — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/full-teardown-playbook.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-full-teardown-playbook-phase-5-auth-flow-analy.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- **Session model**: where tokens live (cookie vs localStorage), flags (HttpOnly/Secure/
  SameSite), rotation on privilege change, fixation vectors, ?token= URL params (HOLY SHIT:
  session fixation via referrer/history).
- **OAuth flows**: state validation, redirect_uri validation, token-in-fragment leakage,
  PKCE enforcement.
- **Password/account flows**: enumeration via response/timing divergence, reset-token
  entropy and single-use enforcement.
- **Verification gates**: server-side verification or stateless claim gate? (hash-verify →
  empty-body claim + no server-to-server callback = farm hypothesis; CVSS ~7.5 documented).
- Deliverable: session/OAuth/reset findings, stateless-verification hypotheses.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
