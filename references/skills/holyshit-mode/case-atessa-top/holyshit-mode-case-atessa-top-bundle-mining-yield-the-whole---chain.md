# Bundle-mining yield (the whole engagement came from here) — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-atessa-top.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-atessa-top-bundle-mining-yield-the-whole-.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-smtp-commands`, `nmap-smtp-enum-users`, `swaks`, `dig-mx`, `dig-txt`
- chains: `mail-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- Endpoint list via `grep -oE '"/[a-zA-Z0-9_/.-]{2,80}"'` — full app-plane map incl. wrapper call-sites (`QK(i,o,r)` = login(email,pw,captcha_token)).
- i18n strings → voucher format `GIFT-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX`, feature inventory (affiliates, reseller RS keys, credit transfers, image library).
- Lazy chunks → `TurnstileWidget` → public captcha-config.
- No hardcoded secrets / backdoor IDs found.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
