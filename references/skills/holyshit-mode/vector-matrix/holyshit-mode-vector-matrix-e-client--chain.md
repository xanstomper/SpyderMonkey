# E. CLIENT — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/vector-matrix.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-vector-matrix-e-client.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- XSS: stored/reflected/DOM, every sink (innerHTML, eval, document.write, postMessage targets)
- postMessage: wildcard targetOrigin, unvalidated origin on receive
- DOM clobbering / CSS injection / clickjacking (missing XFO/frame-ancestors)
- Sourcemaps deployed (.map) — full source recovery
- Service worker / cache poisoning of asset URLs
- Client-side secrets: API keys, feature flags, internal hostnames in bundles
- Dependency rot: dead third-party scripts/invites/widgets (hijackable references)

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
