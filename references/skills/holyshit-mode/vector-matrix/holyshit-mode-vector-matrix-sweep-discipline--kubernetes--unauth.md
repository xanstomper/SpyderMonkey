# SWEEP DISCIPLINE — kubernetes / unauth

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/vector-matrix.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-vector-matrix-sweep-discipline.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**
- context: **kubernetes** · auth **unauth** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: RBAC/service-account surface — read-only enumeration, crown the exposure
- auth state: no credential material — the classic differential applies as-is; absent auth = the authn-bypass class

## The technique

- One decisive probe per cell. A negative result IS a result — log it as coverage evidence.
- Escalate only on signal. No blind CVE spam, no spray-and-pray.
- HOLY SHIT = confirmed cell with impact narrative + kill-chain position. Everything else
  is documented coverage.
- All probes respect the mandate scope gate: scoped targets only, non-destructive, revert
  map before any state change, disclosure path for anything outside own infrastructure.

## Probe adjustment (kubernetes × unauth)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
