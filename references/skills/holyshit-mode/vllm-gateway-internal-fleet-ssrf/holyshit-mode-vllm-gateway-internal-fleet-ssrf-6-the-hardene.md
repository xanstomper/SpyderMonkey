# 6. The hardened-auth fingerprint (so you stop and don't brute)

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/vllm-gateway-internal-fleet-ssrf.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- generated: 2026-11-04

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

Server-side PKCE Supabase/GoTrue is the OPPOSITE of the g***REDACTED*** client-side-exposed version:
- **Zero `createClient`/`anonKey`/`supabase` refs in ANY crawled JS chunk** → anon key never ships
  to the browser; GoTrue signup/verify unreachable keyless.
- **`redirect_to` is hardcoded server-side** in the OAuth authorize URL (every `redirect_to=<evil>`
  override ignored) → no OAuth redirect_uri forge (contrast: g***REDACTED*** forwarded verbatim).
- Turnstile on every bootstrap route; opaque DB `session_id`; `spend-unlock` → `no_session`.
When these all hold, say "auth wall hardened, no unauth forge" and move on — do NOT brute or
fabricate a bypass. The real find is then the internal fleet, not the auth stack.
