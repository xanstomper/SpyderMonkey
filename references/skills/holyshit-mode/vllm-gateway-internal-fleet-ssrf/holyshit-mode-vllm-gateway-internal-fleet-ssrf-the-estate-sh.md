## The technique

- **Public gateway + web platform = hardened** (server-side auth, keyless-recon-only). The
  compromisable surface on THIS class of product is the **internal serving fleet** the public
  gateway routes through — one misconfigured lane = whole crown.
- Fleet pattern: `*.xplabs.ai` with per-provider lanes. `gateway.<d>/{glm,qwen}/v1` were
  **properly keyed (401 Invalid API Key)** while `wm.<d>` (deepseek lane) left `/invocations` +
  `/scale_elastic_ep` + `/generative_scoring` + `/load` + `/detokenize` **completely unauth**.
  **Contrast = proof of misconfiguration**, not platform-wide behavior.
- Keyless `/api/models` **+ `/api/models/<slug>` catalog** leaked the internal `base_url`s and
  provider wiring (see below) — the recon gift that made everything else possible.
