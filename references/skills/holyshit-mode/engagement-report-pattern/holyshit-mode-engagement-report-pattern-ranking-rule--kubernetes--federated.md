# Ranking rule — kubernetes / federated

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/engagement-report-pattern.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-engagement-report-pattern-ranking-rule.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CRYPTO-04** · **CWE-329** · **ATT&CK T1573**
- context: **kubernetes** · auth **federated** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: RBAC/service-account surface — read-only enumeration, crown the exposure
- auth state: identity rides an external IdP (OAuth/OIDC/SAML/SSO): the differential is the TOKEN — audience, issuer, redirect_uri, scope downgrades, code/state reuse, and the exchange at the resource server; the local session may be fine while the trust boundary is not

## The technique

`confirmed(3) > inconclusive(2) > hypothesis(1) > negative(0)`, then score desc within a
tier. Implemented as `sorted(classes.items(), key=lambda kv: (-rank(status), -score))`.
Confirmed classes always outrank hypotheses even if the hypothesis has a higher raw score —
a proven finding is worth more than an unproven high-scoring guess.

## Probe adjustment (kubernetes × federated)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
