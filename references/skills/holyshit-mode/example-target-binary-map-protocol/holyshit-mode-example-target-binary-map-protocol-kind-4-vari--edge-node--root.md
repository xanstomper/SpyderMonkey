# Kind 4 — variable-length records (`en`-byte records, type table `Zd`) — edge-node / root

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/example-target-binary-map-protocol.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-example-target-binary-map-protocol-kind-4-vari.md`
- bindings: **MASTG-RES** · **CWE-288** · **ATT&CK T1557**
- context: **edge-node** · auth **root** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-slowloris-check`, `curl`
- chains: `web`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: cdn/origin edge — cache key and origin-pull trust are the class surface
- auth state: the highest local principal — confirm the class from the top down (downgrade/view-as tests, no-gain reads are the crown)

## The technique

`recordCount` from header; each record: first byte indexes table `Zd`, followed by typed fields via `Zd[r.getUint8(...)]` descriptor. (Not fully enumerated — event was quiet.)

## Probe adjustment (edge-node × root)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
