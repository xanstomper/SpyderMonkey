# Kind 4 — variable-length records (`en`-byte records, type table `Zd`) — worker / unauth

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/example-target-binary-map-protocol.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-example-target-binary-map-protocol-kind-4-vari.md`
- bindings: **MASTG-RES** · **CWE-288** · **ATT&CK T1557**
- context: **worker** · auth **unauth** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-slowloris-check`, `curl`
- chains: `web`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: edge/background runtime — the check runs where the caller has no visible context
- auth state: no credential material — the classic differential applies as-is; absent auth = the authn-bypass class

## The technique

`recordCount` from header; each record: first byte indexes table `Zd`, followed by typed fields via `Zd[r.getUint8(...)]` descriptor. (Not fully enumerated — event was quiet.)

## Probe adjustment (worker × unauth)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
