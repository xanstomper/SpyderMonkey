# Turnstile harvesting — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-apimart-newapi-fork.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-apimart-newapi-fork-turnstile-harvesting.md`
- chain role: **entry — this OPENS a chain: everything after pairs with it; chain detect looks for same-origin findings that follow**

## Chain roles

- entry — this OPENS a chain: everything after pairs with it; chain detect looks for same-origin findings that follow

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

Headless Playwright (firefox) often fails to render the widget:
`[Cloudflare Turnstile] Unable to find onload callback 'onloadTurnstileCallback'`. The target's own
integration can be half-broken — if the widget never mints tokens for real users either,
server-side enforcement may be flaky. Test `?turnstile=garbage` once the rate limit allows.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
