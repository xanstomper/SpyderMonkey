# Honest ceiling — host / guest

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/hardened-gateway-internal-fleet-proto-surface.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-hardened-gateway-internal-fleet-proto-surface-.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**
- context: **host** · auth **guest** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `s3scanner`, `cloudbrute`, `cloudlist`, `kube-hunter`, `shodan`
- chains: `cloud-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: era-stack banner mapping (kaisha cve) before any rung
- auth state: a filter/WAF tier fronts the target: expect canonicalization and signature matching on the raw request — the probe vocabulary's encodings (double-encode, unicode, backslash, case-split) exist exactly for this tier; the differential must clear the filter WITHOUT tripping it, or the finding is a WAF flag, not a class confirmation. Low-and-slow: one variant per request, never a burst.

## The technique

The worker pods are self-contained: no SSRF (`url`/`base_url`/`endpoint` params ignored or time out),
no IMDS/cloud-metadata reach, no `/v1/keys` mint, no RCE. Escalation to key-mint / org-admin / BYOK-secret
drain requires passing the auth wall (authenticated context). When the operator insists "there's
definitely a way past", re-probe the auth surface fresh; if genuinely hardened, record a **negative**
(`auth_wall_hardened_no_bypass`) and state the ceiling — never fabricate a forge or escalation.

## Probe adjustment (host × guest)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
