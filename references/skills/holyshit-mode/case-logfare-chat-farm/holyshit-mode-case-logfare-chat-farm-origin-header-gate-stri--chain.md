# Origin-header gate = string match, not security — chain composition

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-logfare-chat-farm.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-case-logfare-chat-farm-origin-header-gate-stri.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

`/api/*` on chat host returns 403 for evil/null/absent Origin. But:
1. `Origin: https://chat.logfare.ai` from curl bypasses entirely.
2. Discriminator: `GET /api/models` → 403 with evil Origin, 200 with allowed Origin — reveals the gate is header-only.
3. `POST /api/chat` with allowed Origin → server MINTS anon `lfc_session` cookie (HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; **Max-Age 7776000 = 90 days**) and completes the request.
4. **Existing sessions work with NO Origin header at all** — Origin required only at MINT.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
