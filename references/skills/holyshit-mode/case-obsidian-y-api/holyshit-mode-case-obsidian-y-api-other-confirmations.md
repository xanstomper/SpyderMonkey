- source canon: `holyshit-mode/case-obsidian-y-api.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHZ-04** · **CWE-639** · **ATT&CK T1068**

## Route

- probes: `httpx`, `nuclei-tokens`, `arjun`, `kiterunner`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

- `stream:true` works on /pg/chat; upstream model identifiers leak (`glm-4.7-flash:latest`, `fp_ollama`).
- `conversation_id` in response is NOT IDOR-able (server regenerates/ignores supplied values).
- CORS `ACAO: *` but Bearer-auth (no cookies) → config-flaw-only, not exploitable alone.
- Negative: no /pg/* admin surfaces, no PII endpoints, junk keys rejected uniformly.
