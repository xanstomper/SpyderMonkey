# Not every publicly-pushed value is a leak — websocket / machine

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/web-integrity-masking-leaks.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-web-integrity-masking-leaks-not-every-publicly.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**
- context: **websocket** · auth **machine** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: state carries across frames — the replay/state-bypass classes apply frame-to-frame
- auth state: the principal is a SERVICE identity (API key, SA token, CI secret, webhook signing key): the differential is the KEY's resource scope — key-level vs user-level objects, cross-tenant reach, unscoped keys, and which audit trail the key leaves; the human account model does not apply

## The technique

A "next round" field can be the REFERENCE state the game publishes for gameplay:
hilo announces `apriori: {color, number}` = the CURRENT card players bet
higher/lower against (public BY DESIGN). Check the game rules before reporting
an outcome leak — the genuinely hidden value arrives only in an authed event.

## Probe adjustment (websocket × machine)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
