# Class lesson: re-read old negatives narrowly (2026-10-10) — websocket / low-priv

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/web-auth-chain-playbook.md`
- base technique: `holyshit-mode-web-auth-chain-playbook-class-lesson-re-read-o.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- context: **websocket** · auth **low-priv** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-smtp-commands`, `nmap-smtp-enum-users`, `swaks`, `dig-mx`, `dig-txt`
- chains: `mail-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: state carries across frames — the replay/state-bypass classes apply frame-to-frame
- auth state: hold ONE low-priv principal; swap object ids/roles upward only (idor/authz classes)

## The technique

"SMS OTP dead" (verify path) coexisted with phone SIGNUP autoconfirm returning full sessions.
Negatives are scoped to the exact endpoint probed, not the feature family — enumerate sibling
endpoints (signup vs verify vs recover vs magiclink) before declaring an auth feature dead.
Also: email delivery may be broken server-side (signup confirm + email-change + recover all
silently dropped; verify with a healthy public-inbox API like Mailinator v2 as control).

## Probe adjustment (websocket × low-priv)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
