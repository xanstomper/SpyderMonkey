# Recon anchors (do these first) — chain composition

## Chain roles

- entry — this OPENS a chain: everything after pairs with it; chain detect looks for same-origin findings that follow

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- `GET /auth/v1/settings` — provider map, `phone_autoconfirm`, `mailer_autoconfirm`, `sms_provider`.
- `GET /api/status`, `GET /api/providers` — many SPAs expose fleet/config disclosure unauthenticated.
- SPA bundle: enumerate lazy route chunks (grep main.js for `./XxxPage-*.js`, fetch `/assets/<name>.js`)
  — the settings/keys route chunk holds the API surface (`/api/account/platform-keys`, etc.).
  Endpoint lists extracted from the landing chunks only are INCOMPLETE.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
