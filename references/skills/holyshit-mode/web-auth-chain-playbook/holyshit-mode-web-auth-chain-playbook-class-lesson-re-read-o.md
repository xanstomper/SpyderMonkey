# Class lesson: re-read old negatives narrowly (2026-10-10)

- source canon: `holyshit-mode/web-auth-chain-playbook.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHN** · **CWE-287** · **ATT&CK T1111**
- generated: 2026-11-07

## Route

- probes: `nmap-smtp-commands`, `nmap-smtp-enum-users`, `swaks`, `dig-mx`, `dig-txt`
- chains: `mail-full`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

"SMS OTP dead" (verify path) coexisted with phone SIGNUP autoconfirm returning full sessions.
Negatives are scoped to the exact endpoint probed, not the feature family — enumerate sibling
endpoints (signup vs verify vs recover vs magiclink) before declaring an auth feature dead.
Also: email delivery may be broken server-side (signup confirm + email-change + recover all
silently dropped; verify with a healthy public-inbox API like Mailinator v2 as control).
