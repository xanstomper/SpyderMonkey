# R5 — Checkout/order state-machine bypass (e-commerce/booking)

- source canon: `undercroft/undercroft-playbook.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-slowloris-check`, `curl`
- chains: `web`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## The technique

1. `undercroft stateflow --states "cart,paid,fulfilled,refunded" --guard "fulfilled:paid,refunded:paid" --flow checkout --target <c>`
2. Drive the generated matrix with your own orders: fire later transitions from
   earlier states (N+2 before N+1).
3. CONFIRMED when the flow lands in an undocumented state (e.g. refunded order
   that still fulfills, fulfilled without payment).
4. Reverse: cancel/void your own test orders. `craft` as STATE, `export`.
