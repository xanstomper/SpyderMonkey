# R4 — Trial/TTL boundary crossing (SaaS/booking/anything time-gated) — graphql / root

- source canon: `undercroft/undercroft-playbook.md`
- base technique: `undercroft-undercroft-playbook-r4-trial-ttl-boundary-crossin.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-ATHZ-04** · **CWE-639** · **ATT&CK T1068**
- context: **graphql** · auth **root** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: aliases and batched queries bypass field-level checks; type confusion lives in the schema
- auth state: the highest local principal — confirm the class from the top down (downgrade/view-as tests, no-gain reads are the crown)

## The technique

1. Map the documented boundary: trial end, grace period, token TTL.
2. Fire the gated action at boundary−1s, boundary+1s (clock skew only on
   infrastructure you control).
3. CONFIRMED when expired-but-accepted (or pre-expiry grant) occurs.
4. Reverse: revert the granted state. `craft` as TIME, `export`.

## Probe adjustment (graphql × root)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
