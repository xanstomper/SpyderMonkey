# Rule quality bar — chain composition

- source canon: `kage/mirror-playbook.md`
- base technique: `kage-mirror-playbook-rule-quality-bar.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- One attack class per rule (no kitchen-sink detection).
- Match on BEHAVIOR (hash/window/diff), not indicators — rules survive tool swaps.
- Every rule carries a re-fire test: the family re-fires the attack read-only
  and the rule MUST fire; a rule that cannot fire is a hypothesis.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
