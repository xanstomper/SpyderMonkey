# The alias policy (v1.2 — `alias`) — chain composition

- source canon: `barbican/protection-playbook.md`
- base technique: `barbican-protection-playbook-the-alias-policy-v1-2-alias.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Chain roles

- pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

- Derivation: `ghost-` + first 6 hex of sha256(`target#epoch`) — deterministic
  per target+epoch, stable across sessions, no randomness to lose.
- Rotation: `--rotate` bumps the epoch → new alias per engagement window. The
  posture's `--alias` (human-chosen) always wins over the derived suggestion.
- Artifacts carry the alias, NEVER the operator identity — and `sanitize` is the
  enforcement pass that makes it true on disk.

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
