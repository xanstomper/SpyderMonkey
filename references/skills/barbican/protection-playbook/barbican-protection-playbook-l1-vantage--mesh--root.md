# L1 — VANTAGE — mesh / root

- source canon: `barbican/protection-playbook.md`
- base technique: `barbican-protection-playbook-l1-vantage.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-CONF-04** · **CWE-530** · **ATT&CK T1552**
- context: **mesh** · auth **root** · chain role **pivot**

## Route

- probes: `nmap-script-default`, `httpx`, `whatweb`, `webanalyze`
- chains: `recon`
- gate: every probe runs through the shared scope authority (rc=1 out of estate); the 3-gate differential turns output into a finding

## Context

- platform: service-mesh sidecar surface — own mesh, read-only mTLS posture
- auth state: the highest local principal — confirm the class from the top down (downgrade/view-as tests, no-gain reads are the crown)

## The technique

| Audit | Synthesis |
|---|---|
| default route (residential iface = CRITICAL) | posture declares vm/vps/vpn/lab as THE sanctioned exit |
| proxy/VPN env + resolver config | engagement shells verify the route before firing |
| target-side logs will show the vantage — assume it's recorded forever | never mix personal browsing with engagement vantage |

## Probe adjustment (mesh × root)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
