# L3 — ARTIFACTS — chain composition

- source canon: `barbican/protection-playbook.md`
- base technique: `barbican-protection-playbook-l3-artifacts.md`
- chain role: **pivot — this BRIDGES a chain: an entry finding upstream plus this pivot plus a final downstream**

## Pairing rule

chain detect pairs same-origin findings (the `_origin()` key: scheme + netloc). This technique composes when a sibling finding shares that origin and the pattern's two legs match. Never invent a chain: both legs need their own baseline→attack→diff proof first.

## Composition

| Audit | Synthesis |
|---|---|
| reports/logs/states containing identity strings | single compartment: ~/.redteam/ only — never Desktop/Documents/cloud-synced paths |
| canon files (learned-vectors, recipes, chains) | sanitize covers canon TOO (the alias rule is family-wide) |
| scratch/tmp leftovers | wipe at engagement end (24h-prune catches the rest) |

## Walls

- a chain is a SEVERITY judgment over proven findings — never new execution
- every leg keeps its own ledger row and its own evidence
