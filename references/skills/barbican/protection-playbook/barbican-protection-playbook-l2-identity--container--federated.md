# L2 — IDENTITY — container / federated

- source canon: `barbican/protection-playbook.md`
- base technique: `barbican-protection-playbook-l2-identity.md`
- bindings: **WSTG-BUSL-08** · **CWE-841** · **ATT&CK T1574**
- context: **container** · auth **federated** · chain role **pivot**

## Context

- platform: namespace/capability surface — read-only inventory, no escape execution
- auth state: identity rides an external IdP (OAuth/OIDC/SAML/SSO): the differential is the TOKEN — audience, issuer, redirect_uri, scope downgrades, code/state reuse, and the exchange at the resource server; the local session may be fine while the trust boundary is not

## The technique

| Audit | Synthesis |
|---|---|
| git user.email: personal = CRITICAL; noreply form = acceptable | engagement alias in posture; commits carry alias@users.noreply |
| username in file paths (reports, logs, JSON states) | sanitize rewrites /home/<user> → /home/<alias> |
| shell env markers (AI_AGENT, HERMES_AGENT) | engagement shells: `env -i bash -lc` |
| hostname strings in artifacts | sanitize rewrites to "op-host" |

## Probe adjustment (container × federated)

1. baseline first: the request/session with NOTHING changed
2. attack: the documented class probe, adjusted per context above
3. diff: measurable only — status/length/body — or it is not a finding

## Chain roles

- combines with a prior finding — chain detect pairs same-origin findings
- pairs-with: see `skilltree-index.md` for the sibling techniques

## Walls

- validation-only · NO-GAIN · documented-class adaptation only
- in-scope only: the scope authority refuses everything else (rc=1)
